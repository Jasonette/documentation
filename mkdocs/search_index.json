If you are not familiar with JSON syntax, check out the link above, takes 2 minutes.\n\n\n\n\nTutorial Screencast\n\n\nLearn the basics\n\n\nThis video walks you through the basics of Jasonette, such as how it works, how to get started, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn JASON syntax\n\n\nThis video teaches you how to actually write a JSON markup to build sophisticated interactive layouts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\nAnatomy of a Jason view\n\n\nLearn the basic structure of a JASON view\n\nJust like HTML has basic tags such as body, div, span, li, etc, Jasonette has JSON based tags to describe the structure of a view.\n\n\n\n\nComponents\n\n\nLearn component syntax\n\nComponents are the most basic units of user interface, such as image, label, textarea, button, slider, etc. \n\n\n\n\nLayout\n\n\nLearn layouts\n\nIn many cases we combine multiple components to contstruct a unit. We use layouts to do this.\n\n\n\n\nLink multiple views\n\n\nLearn linking\n\nAbove three sections are all you need to know to display content in a view. But what if we want multiple views? We can link them using \nhref\n.\n\n\n\n\nActions\n\n\nLearn actions\n\nActions define a task or a sequence of tasks you wish to run, such as network request, audio play, camera access, geolocation, dispalying banners, etc.\n\n\n\n\nTemplates\n\n\nLearn templates\n\nYou can use templates to dynamically render data, such as remote network content, local data, and user input.\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nActual JSON examples you can try out with Jasonette:\n\n\nTry examples here\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshoot\n\n\nSomething not working?\n\n\n\n\n\"No provisioning...\" error\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust press \"Fix Issue\" and sign in with your Apple account\n\n\nIf that doesn't work, read this post\n\n\n\n\n\"Untrusted Enterprise Developer\"\n\n\nKeep getting \"Untrusted Enterprise Developer\" alert when you try to open the installed app?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr read the Apple Guideline below:\n\n\nGuidelines for installing custom enterprise apps on iOS",

This is called \ninline styling\n since the style attribute is attached to the UI component directly.\n\n\nNow if you look closer, you'll see that each item has exactly the same repeating style.\n\n\nWe would like to get rid of this redundancy by using \nhead.styles\n:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n      \n\"styles\": {\n        \"styled_row\": {\n          \"font\": \"HelveticaNeue\",\n          \"size\": \"20\",\n          \"color\": \"#ff0000\",\n          \"padding\": \"10\"\n        }\n      }\n\n    },\n    \"body\": {\n      \"sections\": [{\n        \"items\": [{\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 1\",\n          \n\"class\": \"styled_row\"\n\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 2\",\n          \n\"class\": \"styled_row\"\n\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 3\",\n          \n\"class\": \"styled_row\"\n\n        }]\n      }]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nFirst look at each label item. Now the style attributes are gone, but instead we have a \nclass\n value of \nstyled_row\n for each.\n\n\nNow let's look under \n$jason.head.styles\n. You'll see we now have the \nstyled_row\n defined here. The styles registered here will be applied to each UI component whenever its class name is referenced.\n\n\n\n\nhead.actions\n\n\nUsing action registry to define actions\n\n\nYou can define actions under the action registry (\nhead.actions\n) and reuse them through \ntrigger\n keyword.\n\n\n\n\nhead.templates\n\n\nDeclaring templates\n\n\nYou can dynamically render any data using templates. Templates are registered under \nhead.templates\n\n\n\n\nhead.data\n\n\nUsing inline data for rendering\n\n\nhead.data\n is like an inline database that gets rendered automatically by \nbody\n template if included.

            "text": "Declare commonly used style classes here so you can reuse them later.  Let's take a look at an example to demonstrate how using  head.styles  can be helpful compared to styling UI elements  inline .  For example here's an example of  inline styling :  {\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n    },\n    \"body\": {\n      \"sections\": [{\n        \"items\": [{\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 1\",\n           \"style\": {\n            \"font\": \"HelveticaNeue\",\n            \"size\": \"20\",\n            \"color\": \"#ff0000\",\n            \"padding\": \"10\"\n          } \n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 2\",\n           \"style\": {\n            \"font\": \"HelveticaNeue\",\n            \"size\": \"20\",\n            \"color\": \"#ff0000\",\n            \"padding\": \"10\"\n          } \n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 3\",\n           \"style\": {\n            \"font\": \"HelveticaNeue\",\n            \"size\": \"20\",\n            \"color\": \"#ff0000\",\n            \"padding\": \"10\"\n          } \n        }]\n      }]\n    }\n  }\n}  You can see that there's a  style  JSON for each label item. This is called  inline styling  since the style attribute is attached to the UI component directly.  Now if you look closer, you'll see that each item has exactly the same repeating style.  We would like to get rid of this redundancy by using  head.styles :  {\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n       \"styles\": {\n        \"styled_row\": {\n          \"font\": \"HelveticaNeue\",\n          \"size\": \"20\",\n          \"color\": \"#ff0000\",\n          \"padding\": \"10\"\n        }\n      } \n    },\n    \"body\": {\n      \"sections\": [{\n        \"items\": [{\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 1\",\n           \"class\": \"styled_row\" \n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 2\",\n           \"class\": \"styled_row\" \n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 3\",\n           \"class\": \"styled_row\" \n        }]\n      }]\n    }\n  }\n}  First look at each label item. Now the style attributes are gone, but instead we have a  class  value of  styled_row  for each.  Now let's look under  $jason.head.styles . You'll see we now have the  styled_row  defined here. The styles registered here will be applied to each UI component whenever its class name is referenced.",

You can chain multiple actions to execute in sequence this way. (optional)\n\n\nerror\n: You can handle exceptions by attaching \nerror\n to an action. (optional)\n\n\ntrigger\n: Or you can simply \ntrigger an existing action by name\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nNetwork request and then render\n\n\nMake a network request and \n$render\n its content when it succeeds.\n\n\n{\n  \"action\": {\n    \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://jasonbase.com/things/jYJ.json\"\n    },\n    \"success\": {\n      \"type\": \"$render\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nNetwork request and then render, with error handling\n\n\nSame as above, except display a banner when the request fails.\n\n\n{\n  \"action\": {\n    \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://jasonbase.com/things/jYJ.json\"\n    },\n    \"success\": {\n      \"type\": \"$render\"\n    },\n    \"error\": {\n      \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"title\": \"Error\",\n        \"description\": \"Something went wrong.\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nTriggerring an action by name\n\n\nFirst, you need to define the action inside \nhead.actions\n. In this case we name it \nrefresh_view\n:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"refresh_view\": {\n          \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"url\": \"https://jasonbase.com/things/jYJ.json\"\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$render\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\nSecond, to actually trigger it by name, just attach an action with a \ntrigger\n attribute, like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"label\",\n  \"text\": \"Refresh\",\n  \"action\": {\n    \"trigger\": \"refresh_view\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nReturn values\n\n\nYou can access an action's return value by using the variable \n$jason\n from the next action (either the \nsuccess\n or the \nerror\n action).\n\n\nFor example, \n$geo.get\n action returns the geolocation of the current device in the following format:\n\n\n{\n  \"coords\": \"51.5032510,-0.1278950\"\n}\n\n\n\nWhich means we can use this return value by accessing the \n$jason\n variable, using a \ntemplate\n like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$geo.get\",\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"title\": \"Your current coordinate\",\n      \"description\": \"{{$jason.coords}}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nWhere to use actions?\n\n\nActions can be used in various situations:\n\n\n\n\nHandling user interaction\n\n\nHandling another action's result\n\n\nHandling system events\n\n\n\n\nLet's go through each:\n\n\nA. Handling user interaction\n\n\n\u25a0 User touches an item\n\n\nAttach \naction\n attribute to \nitems\n, \nmenu\n, \nlayers\n, etc. to react to touch. (Read API documentation to see if a component supports \naction\n attribute)\n\n\nIn the example below, an \naction\n is attached to a \nmenu\n, so it gets triggered when user touches it.\n\n\n{\n  \"head\": {\n    ...\n  },\n  \"body\": {\n    \"header\": {\n      \"menu\": {\n        \"text\": \"Press me\",\n        \n\"action\": {\n          \"type\": \"$util.alert\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"title\": \"Good job!\",\n            \"description\": \"You know how to press a button!\"\n          }\n        }\n\n      }\n    },\n    ...\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\u25a0 User changes a form input value\n\n\nThere are some form input components such as \nslider\n, \nsearch\n, etc. which trigger an action whenever its value changes. Just attach \naction\n attribute to handle that event.\nIn the example below, an \naction\n is attached to a \nslider\n, so we can display a banner with the current value whenever user changes the value.\n\n\n{\n  ...\n  {\n    \"type\": \"slider\",\n    \"name\": \"gauge\",\n    \n\"action\": {\n      \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"title\": \"Current value\",\n        \"description\": \"{{$get.gauge}}\"\n      }\n    }\n\n  }\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\nB. Handling another action's result\n\n\nAll actions can have a \nsuccess\n and an \nerror\n attribute.\n\n\n\n\nsuccess\n points to an action to be triggered after the current action finishes.\n\n\nerror\n points to an action to be triggered if something goes wrong with the current action.\n\n\n\n\nBy using \nsuccess\n, we can chain multiple actions.\n\n\nIn the example below, a \n$network.request\n action gets called when a user touches the label, renders the result when it succeeds (\nsuccess\n), and displays an error message when something goes wrong (\nerror\n).\n\n\n{\n  ...\n  {\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": \"Touch me\",\n    \"action\": {\n      \n\"type\": \"$network.request\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"url\": \"https://www.jasonclient.org/items.json\"\n      },\n\n      \n\"success\": {\n        \n\"type\": \"$render\"\n\n      },\n      \"error\": {\n        \n\"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n        \"options\": {\n          \"title\": \"Error\",\n          \"description\": \"Uh oh, something went wrong.\"\n        }\n\n      }\n\n    }\n  }\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\nC. Handling system events\n\n\nSystem events\n are events automatically triggered by the system, instead of through user input.\n\n\nYou can attach any \naction\n to system events, such as \n$load\n, \n$show\n, \n$foreground\n, etc.\n\n\nHere's a brief example:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"$load\": {\n          \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"url\": \"https://jasonbase.com/things/jYJ.json\"\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$render\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"$show\": {\n          \"type\": \"$reload\"\n        },\n        \"$foreground\": {\n          \"type\": \"$reload\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    ...\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nLearn more about system events\n\n\n\n\nDeclaring actions\n\n\nThere are two ways you can call actions:\n\n\n1. Inline action\n\n\nAttach \naction\n attributes directly to UI elements\n\n\n2. Action registry\n\n\nDefine actions inside \n$jason.head.actions\n and call them by name\n\n\n\n\nInline Action\n\n\nInline actions are basically what we've been talking about so far. You directly attach an \naction\n to events, UI components, and another action. Here's an example:\n\n\n{\n  ...\n  \"type\": \"label\",\n  \"action\": {\n    \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"title\": \"Hello\",\n      \"description\": \"World\"\n    }\n  }\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Registry\n\n\nWe can define an action once and refer to them whenever we need to, instead of writing one for every situation.\n\n\n\u25a0   Comparison with inline actions\n\n\nFor example, here's an \ninline action\n example. We display multiple \nitems\n, and each item has the same \naction\n attribute content.\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n    },\n    \"body\": {\n      \"sections\": [{\n        \"items\": [{\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 1\",\n          \n\"action\": {\n            \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n            \"options\": {\n              \"url\": \"https://jasonclient.org/submit\",\n              \"method\": \"POST\"\n            },\n            \"success\": {\n              \"type\": \"$render\"\n            }\n          }\n\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 2\",\n          \n\"action\": {\n            \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n            \"options\": {\n              \"url\": \"https://jasonclient.org/submit\",\n              \"method\": \"POST\"\n            },\n            \"success\": {\n              \"type\": \"$render\"\n            }\n          }\n\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 3\",\n          \n\"action\": {\n            \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n            \"options\": {\n              \"url\": \"https://jasonclient.org/submit\",\n              \"method\": \"POST\"\n            },\n            \"success\": {\n              \"type\": \"$render\"\n            }\n          }\n\n        }]\n      }]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nBelow we have the same example, but using \n$jason.head.actions\n instead of re-defining the same action every time inline:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n      \"actions\": {\n        \n\"submit_item\": {\n          \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"url\": \"https://jasonclient.org/submit\",\n            \"method\": \"POST\"\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$render\"\n          }\n        }\n\n      }\n    },\n    \"body\": {\n      \"sections\": [{\n        \"items\": [{\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 1\",\n          \n\"action\": {\n            \"trigger\": \"submit_item\"\n          }\n\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 2\",\n          \n\"action\": {\n            \"trigger\": \"submit_item\"\n          }\n\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 3\",\n          \n\"action\": {\n            \"trigger\": \"submit_item\"\n          }\n\n        }]\n      }]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nHere's what's going on:\n\n\n\n\nDeclare an action under \n$jason.head.actions\n (in this case we've named it \nsubmit_item\n).\n\n\nThen we \ntrigger\n the action from anywhere using the name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0   System events\n\n\nSome actions are automatically triggered by the system when a certain event occurs. When you wish to take advantage of these, simply add them to \nactions\n. They are:\n\n\n\n\n1. $load\n\n\n$load\n gets called once automatically when the view loads for the first time.\n\n\nHere's an example where we make a network request when the view loads, and then render the response using the template.\n\n\n{\n  ...\n  \"$load\": {\n    \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n    \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"http://jasonclient.org/req.json\"\n    },\n    \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$render\"\n    }\n  }\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n2. $show\n\n\n$show\n gets called automatically whenever the view appears. For example when coming back from a modal view, coming back from its next view via back button, etc.\n\n\nHere's an example\n\n\n{\n  ...\n  \"$show\": {\n    \"type\": \"$reload\"\n  },\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n3. $foreground\n\n\n$foreground\n is called automatically whenever the app comes back from the background state.\n\n\n{\n  ...\n  \"$foreground\": {\n    \"type\": \"$reload\"\n  },\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n4. $pull\n\n\n$pull\n gets called whenever user makes a pull to refresh action\n\n\n{\n  ...\n  \"$pull\": {\n    \"type\": \"$reload\"\n  },\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI\n\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 VIEW \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\nactions related to drawing views\n\n\n\n\n$reload\n\n\nRefreshes the view completely by re-fetching content from the current URL.\n\n\n{\n  \"items\": [{\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": \"Refresh\",\n    \"action\": {\n      \"type\": \"$reload\"\n    }\n  }]\n}\n\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 return value\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\nThis will reload the page when a user taps on the \nitem\n.\n\n\n\n\n$render\n\n\nRenders a \ntemplate\n with data\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\n\n\ndata\n: Data to render. If not specified, it's the \n$jason\n value at the point \n$render\n was called.\n\n\ntemplate\n: \nTemplate\n name to render. If not specified, it will look for \n$jason.head.templates.body\n\n\ntype\n: \n\"html\"\n | \n\"json\"\n (Default is \njson\n. See \nhtml templating\n to learn more about how to render an HTML string natively using Jason)\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 return value\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 example\n\n\nRendering return value from the previous action\n\n\nBy default \n$render\n renders the data returned from its previous action. \n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"https://jasonbase.com/things/gbe.json\"\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$render\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nFor example, let's say the network request returns the following result:\n\n\n{\n    \"name\": \"Mr. Fisherman\",\n    \"image\": \"http://i.giphy.com/OmK8lulOMQ9XO.gif\",\n    \"status\": \"Busy fishing on the iPhone\"\n}\n\n\n\nAll Jasonette actions store their return values under \n$jason\n object when they return.\n\n\nSo we can access above value using the \n$jason\n variable.\n\n\n\n\nHere's how we would write the \nbody\n template:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          \"sections\": [{\n            \"items\": [{\n              \"type\": \"image\",\n              \"url\": \"{{$jason.image}}\"\n            }, {\n              \"type\": \"label\",\n              \"text\": \"{{$jason.text}}\"\n            }, {\n              \"type\": \"label\",\n              \"text\": \"{{$jason.status}}\"\n            }]\n          }]\n        }\n      ...\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nSpecifying data when rendering\n\n\nIn most cases you will use the above method--rendering data passed in as a return value from the previous action. \n\n\nHowever, you can also use \n$render\n as standalone, by manually specifying its data, like this (You rarely need to use this method):\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$render\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"data\": [{\n      \"name\": \"Ethan\",\n      \"id\": \"1\"\n    }, {\n      \"name\": \"Jason\",\n      \"id\": \"2\"\n    }, {\n      \"name\": \"Jasonette\",\n      \"id\": \"3\"\n    }]\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nRendering the body template\n\n\nIn most cases you will use \n$render\n without manually specifying the template, because it will assume you're rendering the \nbody\n template. For example, a typical \n$render\n looks like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"https://jasonclient.com/req.json\"\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$render\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nIf no \ntemplate\n option is specified, \n$render\n will look for a \nbody\n template inside \n$jason.head.templates\n and use that to render the data. For example, from the following JSON,\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          \"sections\": [{\n            \"items\": {\n              \"{{#each $jason}}\": {\n                \"type\": \"label\",\n                \"text\": \"{{text}}\"\n              }\n            }\n          }]\n        }\n      ...\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nWhen \n$render\n runs, it will take the JSON markup inside \n$jason.head.templates.body\n, render it using the data, onto the view.\n\n\nManually specifying the template to render\n\n\nBut sometimes you can also specify the template name. For exmaple, we may want to render a template named \nempty\n instead of the default \nbody\n template:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          ....\n        },\n        \"empty_template\": {\n          \"sections\": [{\n            \"items\": [{\n              \"type\": \"label\",\n              \"text\": \"Empty view\"\n            }]\n          }]\n        }\n      ...\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nIn this case we could pass \n{\"template\": \"empty_template\"}\n as an option, like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"https://jasonclient.com/req.json\"\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$render\"\n  },\n  \"error\": {\n    \"type\": \"$render\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"template\": \"empty_template\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nHow is \n$render\n different from \n$reload\n?\n\n\n$render\n redraws an existing template you already downloaded, using dynamic data. \n$reload\n completely refreshes the current URL. Here's an example scenario:\n\n\n\n\nJason view loads and fetches a JSON markup from the server (\nmain.json\n)\n\n\nmain.json\n makes an API request to Twitter to fetch Tweets. (https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/user_timeline.json)\n\n\nThen it renders the result using its \nbody\n template, which is under \n$jason.head.templates.body\n in \nmain.json\n.\n\n\nFrom this point on, calling \n$render\n simply takes the \n$jason.head.templates.body\n we have in memory, and renders whatever data we pass in.\n\n\nHowever calling \n$reload\n will make a full refresh, going back to step 1.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\nIn most cases, you call \n$render\n at the end of an action call chain, rendering the \n$jason\n return value from its preceding action.\n\n\nAlso, in most cases \n$render\n is used without specifying \ntemplate\n or \ndata\n options.\n\n\nJust don't forget to have a template under \n$jason.head.templates.body\n, since \n$render\n will automatically render that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, remember that you can access the return value using \n$jason\n from the template.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$snapshot\n\n\nTakes a snapshot of the currently visible screen\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 return value\n\n\nThe return value is in this format:\n\n\n{\n  \"data\": \"....\",\n  \"data_uri\": \"....\",\n  \"content_type\": \"image/jpeg\",\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nReturns the snapshot as raw data under \ndata\n attribute.\n\n\nAlso returns \ndata_uri\n attribute, which contains the \ndata-uri\n\n\nYou can utilize the \ndata\n by passing it to another action using \nsuccess\n\n\nThe \ncontent_type\n is \n\"image/jpeg\"\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 example\n\n\nTake a snapshot and share\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$snapshot\",\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$util.share\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"items\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"image\",\n          \"data\": \"{{$jason.data}}\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare sheet\n\n\nSMS example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$href\n\n\n\n\nAn action version of \nhref\n. Works the same way, but just another way to invoke href.\n\n\nUse this when a component doesn't support \nhref\n attribute directly but supports an \naction\n.\n\n\nSometimes it's useful when you want to invoke \nhref\n without displaying a disclosure indicator. (href comes with a disclosure indicator by default)\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\nIt's the same set of attributes as \nhref\n since it simply invokes the href when triggered.\n\n\n\n\nurl\n\n\nthe url to transition to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nview\n\n\ncan be \n\"web\"\n | \n\"app\"\n | \n\"jason\"\n (default)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntransition\n\n\ncan be \n\"modal\"\n | \n\"fullscreen\"\n | \n\"push\"\n (default)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0  return value\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 example\n\n\n{\n   \"type\": \"label\",\n   \"text\": \"trigger href\",\n   \"action\": {\n     \"type\": \"$href\",\n     \"options\": {\n       \"url\": \"...\",\n       \"transition\": \"...\",\n       \"view\": \"...\"\n     }\n   }\n}\n\n\n\nis same as:\n\n\n{\n   \"type\": \"label\",\n   \"text\": \"trigger href\",\n   \"href\": {\n     \"url\": \"...\",\n     \"transition\": \"...\",\n     \"view\": \"...\"\n   }\n}\n\n\n\nThe only difference is: in case of \nitems\n the second option displays a disclosure indicator since we're directly using \nhref\n\n\n\n\n$close\n\n\nClose a modal (works when the currently view is a modal)\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 return value\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$back\n\n\nTransition one step back from the current view\n\n\n\n\nIf the current view is a modal, it closes the current view\n\n\nOtherwise it slides back to the previous view\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 return value\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2500\u2500 NETWORK \u2500\u2500\n\n\n\n\n$network.request\n\n\nMake GET/POST/PUT/DELETE network requests\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\n\n\nurl\n: The url to access.\n\n\nmethod\n: \n\"get\"\n | \n\"post\"\n | \n\"put\"\n | \n\"delete\"\n.\n\n\ndata\n: Parameters to send along with the url (optional)\n\n\nheader\n: Headers to attach to every request if any (optional)\n\n\ndata_type\n: Specifies how the fetched response will be processed. Can be \njson\n, \nhtml\n, \nrss\n, or \nraw\n. \njson\n assumes that the return value will be in JSON format, whereas \nraw\n expects a plain text. You can use \nraw\n type when fetching a plain text or CSV. \nhtml\n is for fetching HTML content and especially required when you need to utilize HTML requests associated with cookies/sessions. \nrss\n is used to fetch RSS. The default is \njson\n.\n\n\ncontent_type\n: Specifies which format the parameters will be sent as. By default it's sent as a form object, but in case you specify \n{\"content_type\": \"json\"}\n the data will be submitted as a JSON string.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 return value\n\n\n\n\nWhatever the server returns\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 examples\n\n\nExample 1. Simple JSON GET request\n\n\nHere's a simple example of GET request, fetching JSON. We don't need to specify \n{\"type\": \"get\"}\n here since the default type is \n\"get\"\n\n\n{\n    \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n    \"options\": {\n        \"url\": \"http://plasticfm.herokuapp.com/things/3.json\"\n    },\n    \"success\": {\n        \"type\": \"$render\"\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2. More complex JSON requests\n\n\nThis time we're going to make a POST request, with all the data and header\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"http://www.jasonbase.com/messages.json\",\n    \"method\": \"post\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"user_id\": \"fI9\",\n      \"message\": \"Hello there\"\n    },\n    \"header\": {\n      \"auth_token\": \"fnekfla98dls9sNFK0nf3\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$render\"\n  },\n  \"error\": {\n    \"type\": \"$util.alert\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"title\": \"Error\",\n      \"description\": \"Uh oh, something went wrong\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3. HTML GET request\n\n\nYou can also make HTML type requests. Here's a request with \nhtml\n data_type.\n\n\n{\n    \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n    \"options\": {\n        \"url\": \"https://news.ycombinator.com/newest\",\n        \"dataType\": \"html\"\n    },\n    \"success\": {\n        \"type\": \"$render\",\n        \"options\": {\n            \"type\": \"html\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nIt fetches the url as \nhtml\n type, and then renders it using the \nhtml\n type parser. See templates for more details on how to render HTML content in Jasonette.\n\n\n\n\nExample 4. HTML POST request with cookies\n\n\nDealing with cookies is simple. All you need to do is make the request to create a session. Jason will automatically store the returned cookie, and then attach it to all subsequent requests.\nHere's an example of signing into a website by making an HTML data_type \n$network.request\n call:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"https://news.ycombinator.com/login\",\n    \"method\": \"post\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"acct\": \"{{$get.username}}\",\n      \"pw\": \"{{$get.password}}\"\n    },\n    \"data_type\": \"html\"\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://news.ycombinator.com/saved?id={{$get.username}}\",\n      \"data_type\": \"html\"\n    },\n    \"success\": {\n      \"type\": \"$render\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"type\": \"html\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nIt first signs into the site by making a \nPOST\n request of \n{\"data_type\": \"html\"}\n. Then it stores the cookie returned from the server.\n\n\nOnce the login succeeds, it makes a \nGET\n request of \n{\"data_type\": \"html\"}\n to an actual content API. The cookie from the previous step is automatically applied to the request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$network.upload\n\n\nUpload data to cloud providers. Currently supports S3, but \nfeel free to extend\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\n\n\ntype\n: \n\"s3\"\n (Currently only supports s3)\n\n\nbucket\n: s3 bucket name\n\n\npath\n: the s3 path to upload the file\n\n\nsign_url\n: To upload files to s3, you need to acquire a signed url from S3 first, and then upload it to that URL.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 return value\n\n\n\n\nfile_name\n: a randomly generated filename. When \n$network.upload\n is called, it automatically generates a random, hashed filename to ensure uniqueness, and then stores the file onto the cloud provider with that name.\n\n\nWe need this attribute to keep track of the data we've just uploaded. For example, we may want to store the filename somewhere so we can access this file later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 example\n\n\nThis example takes a photo and uploads to S3.\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$media.camera\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"quality\": \"0.4\"\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$network.upload\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"type\": \"s3\",\n      \"bucket\": \"fm.ethan.jason\",\n      \"data\": \"{{$jason.data}}\",\n      \"path\": \"\",\n      \"sign_url\": \"https://imagejason.herokuapp.com/sign_url\"\n    },\n    \"success\": {\n      \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"url\": \"https://imagejason.herokuapp.com/post\",\n        \"method\": \"post\",\n        \"data\": {\n          \"bucket\": \"fm.ethan.jason\",\n          \"path\": \"/\",\n          \"filename\": \"{{$jason.filename}}\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"success\": {\n        \"type\": \"$reload\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nHere's what's going on above:\n\n\n1. The client takes a photo using the \n$media.camera\n action and passes the raw data to \n$network.upload\n as \n$jason\n.\n\n\n2. The \n$network.upload\n first looks at \noptions.sign_url\n and makes a request to get the signed url.\n\n\n3. The server should return a signed url for S3.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nsign_url\n attribute is the URL to your server, and your server should generate a signed url and return the result in the following format:\n\n\n{ \"$jason\": \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/...../...?AWSAccessKeyId=.....\nExpires=.....\nSignature=.....\"}\n\n\nSee the full server side code\n to learn how to generate signed urls.\n\n\n\n\n4. The client then uploads the content passed in as \ndata\n to the just generated signed url, using a randomly generated filename.\n\n\n5. Once the upload finishes, the \n$network.upload\n returns the filename generated from step 3.\n\n\n6. Then it stores the filename to our server by making a POST \n$network.request\n to \nhttps://imagejason.herokuapp.com/post\n\n\n\nCheck out the full code on Github:\n\n\ns3-upload-examle\n\n\n\n\n\u2500\u2500 SESSION \u2500\u2500\n\n\n\n\nCheck out a functional demo app with backend server, with user accounts\n\n\nsession-example\n\n\n\n\n$session.set\n\n\n\n\n$session.set\n takes care of \ntoken authentication\n to authenticate into any mobile API.\n\n\nYou need to call \n$session.set\n \nafter\n a \n$network.request\n action to an authentication endpoint, which returns an authentication token.\n\n\nFor cookie based HTML authentication, see \nExample 4 from \n$network.request\n above\n.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\n\n\ndomain\n: the domain to set the session for (example: \"jasonbase.com\")\n\n\nheader\n: headers to attach to every future \n$network.request\n to the specified domain.\n\n\nbody\n: body parameters to attach to every future \n$network.request\n to the specified domain.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 return value\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 example\n\n\nHere's an example:\n\n\n\"action\": {\n  \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"https://sessionjason.herokuapp.com/users/sign_in.json\",\n    \"method\": \"post\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"user[email]\": \"{{$get.email}}\",\n      \"user[password]\": \"{{$get.password}}\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$session.set\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"domain\": \"sessionjason.herokuapp.com\",\n      \"header\": {\n        \"X-User-Email\": \"{{$jason.email}}\",\n        \"X-User-Token\": \"{{$jason.authentication_token}}\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"success\": {\n      \"type\": \"$href\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"url\": \"https://sessionjason.herokuapp.com/posts.json\",\n        \"transition\": \"replace\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"error\": {\n    \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"title\": \"Enter credentials\",\n      \"description\": \"Please enter both email and password\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nLet's walk through each step.\n\n\nThe first action is \n$network.request\n. It makes a POST request to \nhttps://sessionjason.herokuapp.com/users/sign_in.json\n, to which the server returns the following JSON as a response:\n\n\n{\n  \"id\":2,\n  \"email\":\"ethan@ethan.fm\",\n  \"created_at\":\"2016-10-14T22:55:00.664Z\",\n  \"updated_at\":\"2016-10-15T05:22:41.730Z\",\n  \"authentication_token\":\"fnekz4hf7ghw95m6ks0rf01j\"\n}\n\n\n\nNext, we proceed to the next action, which is \n$session.set\n. Here we use the return value from the \n$network.request\n and set the header.\n\n\n\n\nThis stores the \nheader\n object for the specified \ndomain\n (session.herokuapp.com), and this stored header will be attached to all future \n$network.request\n to this domain. The header to be stored will look like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"header\": {\n    \"X-User-Email\": \"ethan@ethan.fm\",\n    \"X-User-Token\": \"fnekz4hf7ghw95m6ks0rf01j\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the \n$session.set\n, it goes to the next action \n$href\n. This transitions to \nhttps://sessionjason.herokuapp.com/posts.json\n.\n\n\n\n\nThis time, the network request will automatically attach the stored header to the request.\n\n\n\n\nThe server will recognize the authentication token and respond with the actual \nposts.json\n.\n\n\n\n\n$session.reset\n\n\nThis action lets you clear sessions for a specified domain. Can be used for both \ntoken authentication\n and \nweb authentication via cookies\n\n\n\n\nFor token authentication, it clears your headers and body parameters objects tied to the domain, created through \n$session.set\n.\n\n\nFor web requests (html), it clears your cookie tied to the domain, created through \nhtml\n type \n$network.request\n, \nas described here\n.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0  options\n\n\n\n\nurl\n: The url from which to sign out.\n\n\ndomain\n: The domain from which to sign out (used for APIs)\n\n\ndata\n: Parameters to send along with the url (optional)\n\n\ntype\n: \n\"html\"\n | \n\"json\"\n (Default is \"json\")\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 examples\n\n\nExample 1.

We are setting local variables \nfirstname\n and \nlastname\n to \nethan\n and \ngliechtenstein\n respectively.\n\n\ndo something after setting the local variable\n\n\nIf you're using a local variable in your body template and wish to update the view to reflect the updated local variable, you need to call \n$render\n. \n\n\nFor example you can add a \nsuccess\n attribute to above action to redraw the view after update, like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"label\",\n  \"text\": \"{{$get.firstname}} {{$get.lastname}}\",\n  \"action\": {\n    \"type\": \"$set\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"firstname\": \"ethan\",\n      \"lastname\": \"gliechtenstein\"\n    },\n    \"success\": {\n      \"type\": \"$render\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n$get\n\n\nYou can access local variables by using a template expression \n{{$get.VARIABLE_NAME}}\n\n\n\n\nNormally, the usage flow is:\n\n\nSet a variable using \n$set\n action\n\n\nUse the variable from template through \n{{$get.VARIABLE_NAME}}\n expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 example\n\n\nOnce you set \nfirstname\n and \nlastname\n like we did above, we can use them like this:\n\n\n[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": \"{{$get.firstname}}\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": \"{{$get.lastname}}\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n\nHere's a full usage example using both \n$set\n action and \n$get\n expression.\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"$load\": {\n          \"type\": \"$set\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"bar\": \"#\"\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$render\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"$pull\": {\n          \"type\": \"$set\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"bar\": \"{{$get.bar+'#'}}\"\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$render\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          \"sections\": [{\n            \"items\": [{\n              \"type\": \"label\",\n              \"text\": \"{{$get.bar}}\"\n            }]\n          }]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nHere's what's going on:\n\n\n\n\nWhen the view loads (\n$load\n system event), it sets the local variable \nbar\n's value as \"#\", then renders the template with a label that displays the variable \nbar\n (\n{{$get.bar}}\n).\n\n\nWhen the user makes a pull to refresh gesture (\n$pull\n event), it appends another \"#\" to \nbar\n and then renders again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2500\u2500 CACHE \u2500\u2500\n\n\nCache lets you persist and retrieve content. Unlike local variables, it will stay even when you close the app and come back.\n\n\n\n\nCache vs. Local variable\n\n\n\n\nCache and local variables are both sandboxed per view. Therefore anything you store to cache and local variable is stored just for that view.\n\n\nLocal variables are only on memory so will go away when the view refreshs. But cache is stored persistently and stays until you overwrite or reset it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite\n\n\n$cache.set\n action is used to store to cache.\n\n\n\u25a0  options\n\n\n\n\nkey:value pairs. The key is the cache variable name, and the value is the variable's value.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 return value\n\n\nreturns the updated \n$cache\n object, which looks like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"items\": [...]\n}\n\n\n\n\u25a0 examples\n\n\nExample 1. Set cache\n\n\nIn the following example, it first makes a \n$network.request\n, and then takes its return value \n{{$jason}}\n and stores it to cache using the \n$cache.set\n action.\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"http://jasonclient.org/api/items.json\"\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$cache.set\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"items\": \"{{$jason}}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nExample 2. Set cache and use the updated value\n\n\nSimply setting the cache doesn't update the view. Let's try to render the updated result.\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"http://jasonclient.org/api/items.json\"\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$cache.set\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"items\": \"{{$jason}}\"\n    },\n    \"success\": {\n      \"type\": \"$util.alert\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"title\": \"Items fetched\",\n        \"description\": \"{{$cache.items.length}}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nRead\n\n\nDirectly access \n$cache\n variable from a template expression, for example \n{{$cache.items}}\n.\n\n\n\u25a0 example\n\n\nFor example, you could store a \ntracking_keyword\n value locally and automatically perform a search whenever the document loads.\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$oauth.request\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": SEARCH_URL,\n    \"data\": {\n      \"search_query\": \"{{$cache.tracking_keyword}}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nReset\n\n\nUse \n$cache.reset\n action to reset the cache associated with the current url.\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 return value\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 example\n\n\nThe following will wipe out all the cache values associated with the current view url.\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$cache.reset\"\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2500\u2500 UTIL \u2500\u2500\n\n\nUtility and widget methods\n\n\n\n\n$util.banner\n\n\nDisplays a banner notification with title and description.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\n\n\ntitle\n\n\ndescription\n\n\ntype\n: \n\"error\"\n | \n\"success\"\n | \n\"info\"\n (default)\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0  return value\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0  example\n\n\n{\n    \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n    \"options\": {\n        \"title\": \"Hello World\",\n        \"description\": \"I'm a banner.

The first action is  $network.request . It makes a POST request to  https://sessionjason.herokuapp.com/users/sign_in.json , to which the server returns the following JSON as a response:  {\n  \"id\":2,\n  \"email\":\"ethan@ethan.fm\",\n  \"created_at\":\"2016-10-14T22:55:00.664Z\",\n  \"updated_at\":\"2016-10-15T05:22:41.730Z\",\n  \"authentication_token\":\"fnekz4hf7ghw95m6ks0rf01j\"\n}  Next, we proceed to the next action, which is  $session.set . Here we use the return value from the  $network.request  and set the header.   This stores the  header  object for the specified  domain  (session.herokuapp.com), and this stored header will be attached to all future  $network.request  to this domain. The header to be stored will look like this:  {\n  \"header\": {\n    \"X-User-Email\": \"ethan@ethan.fm\",\n    \"X-User-Token\": \"fnekz4hf7ghw95m6ks0rf01j\"\n  }\n}   After the  $session.set , it goes to the next action  $href . This transitions to  https://sessionjason.herokuapp.com/posts.json .   This time, the network request will automatically attach the stored header to the request.   The server will recognize the authentication token and respond with the actual  posts.json .",

Normally it's recommended to receive content in JSON format and render them using rest of the components.\n\n\nexample\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"title\": \"RSS Reader\",\n      \"description\": \"RSS Parsing example\",\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"$load\": {\n          \"trigger\": \"reload\"\n        },\n        \"reload\": {\n          \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"url\": \"http://feeds.gawker.com/lifehacker/full\",\n            \"dataType\": \"rss\"\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$convert.rss\",\n            \"options\": {\n              \"data\": \"{{$jason}}\"\n            },\n            \"success\": {\n              \"type\": \"$render\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          \"nav\": {\n            \"style\": {\n              \"background\": \"rgb(246, 246, 239)\",\n              \"theme\": \"light\",\n              \"color\": \"#000000\"\n            }\n          },\n          \"style\": {\n            \"background\": \"rgb(246, 246, 239)\",\n            \"color\": \"#000000\",\n            \"border\": \"0\"\n          },\n          \"sections\": {\n            \"{{#each $jason}}\": {\n              \"items\": [\n                \n{\n                  \"type\": \"html\",\n                  \"css\": \"body{font-family: Courier; font-size: 18px;} img{max-width: 100%; border-bottom: 30px solid white !important;}\",\n                  \"text\": \"\n{{summary.replace(/width[ ]\n=[ ]\n\\\"[^\\\"]\n\\\"/gi, '').replace(/height[ ]\n=[ ]\n\\\"[^\\\"]\n\\\"/gi, '')}}\n\"\n                }\n\n              ]\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0  space\n\n\nAn empty space component mostly used for layout purposes.\n\n\n\n\nsyntax\n\n\n\n\nstyle\n\n\nbackground\n: background color (transparent if not specified)\n\n\nwidth\n: only specify if you want a horizontally fixed size space\n\n\nheight\n: only specify if you want a vertically fixed size space\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.

There are several cases where templating makes sense. \nLearn more here\n\n\nTo achieve this we use templates.\n\n\n\n\nTemplates have slots (\n{{ }}\n) to be filled in.\n\n\nAll expressions inside \n{{ }}\n are evaluated with the data in memory and substituted in.\n\n\nTemplates handle not only evaluation but also support \nlooping (\n#each\n) and conditionals (\n#if/#elseif/#else\n)\n. \n\n\nTemplates are always declared under \n$jason.head.templates\n.\n\n\nMost of the times we just use the \nbody\n template (\n$jason.head.templates.body\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvalid expressions\n\n\nJasonette template engine takes advantage of the native javascript engine. This means:\n\n\n1. Any expression that evaluates to a value.\n\n\n{\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"image\",\n      \"url\": \"{{$jason.image}}\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"label\",\n      \"text\": \"{{$jason.username}}\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\n2. Any javascript expression.\n\n\nJasonette implements the native javascript engine to evaluate expressions. So you can use any javascript expression inside \n{{ }}\n.\n\n\n{\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"label\",\n      \"url\": \"Full JSON string\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"label\",\n      \"text\": \"{{JSON.stringify($jason)}}\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\n3. A full fledged javascript function.\n\n\nIf it involves multiple instructions, you can even write a full fledged function inside the template expression.\n\n\nJust make sure to end with a \nreturn\n statement.\n\n\n{\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"label\",\n      \"url\": \"Reversed Fullname\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"label\",\n      \"text\": \"{{var sorted_posts = $jason.posts.sort(function(a,b){ return new Date(b.created_at) - new Date(a.created_at); }); return sorted_posts[0];}}\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\nexample\n\n\nHere's an example where we use the \n$geo.get\n action to get the current location, and render it dynamically using the template.\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"title\": \"Display location\",\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"type\": \"$geo.get\",\n        \"success\": {\n          \"type\": \"$render\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          \"sections\": [{\n            \"items\": [\n              {\n                \"type\": \"label\",\n                \"text\": \"Latitude: \nspan style='color:#ff0000;'\n{{ $jason.coords.split(',')[0] }}\n/span\n\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"type\": \"label\",\n                \"text\": \"Longitude: \nspan style='color:#ff0000;'\n{{ $jason.coords.split(',')[1] }}\n/span\n\"\n              }           \n            ]\n          }]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nIn above JSON markup, the \n$jason.body\n part is missing, because we will dynamically generate it via \n$render\n.\n\n\nThe \n$render\n action will render the data with the template, and insert it into where \n$jason.body\n should be. The result would be:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"title\": \"Display location\",\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"type\": \"$geo.get\",\n        \"success\": {\n          \"type\": \"$render\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          \"sections\": [{\n            \"items\": [\n              {\n                \"type\": \"label\",\n                \"text\": \"Latitude: \nspan style='color:#ff0000;'\n{{ $jason.coords.split(',')[0] }}\n/span\n\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"type\": \"label\",\n                \"text\": \"Longitude: \nspan style='color:#ff0000;'\n{{ $jason.coords.split(',')[1] }}\n/span\n\"\n              }           \n            ]\n          }]\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"body\": {\n      \"sections\": [{\n        \"items\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"label\",\n            \"text\": \"Latitude: 12.1234\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"label\",\n            \"text\": \"Longitude: 23.2345\"\n          }           \n        ]\n      }]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nNotice how we now have the \n$jason.body\n filled out.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 Syntax\n\n\nJSON\n\n\nLet's take a look at how JSON templating works:\n\n\n\n\n1. Loop (#each)\n\n\nTo demonstrate looping, let's look at an example. We have a static JSON that looks like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"body\": {\n    \"sections\": [{\n      \"items\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"Homer\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"Marge\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"Lisa\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"Bart\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"Maggie\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }]\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nIF you look at each item, the only part that's custom is the name (\"Homer\", \"Marge\", \"Lisa\", \"Bart\", \"Maggie\"). We want to shorten this so that we don't have to rewrite \n\"type\": \"label\"\n for every item.\n\n\nFirst, we need to declare a data attribute (\nLearn more about \nhead.data\n):\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"data\": {\n        \"members\": [\n          { \"name\": \"Homer\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Marge\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Lisa\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Bart\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Maggie\" }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nThen we will declare a \nbody\n template that will iterate through this \nmembers\n array and turn each into renderable item.\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"data\": {\n        \"members\": [\n          { \"name\": \"Homer\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Marge\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Lisa\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Bart\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Maggie\" }\n        ]\n      },\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          \"sections\": [{\n            \"items\": {\n              \"{{#each members}}\": {\n                \"type\": \"label\",\n                \"text\": \"{{name}}\"\n              }\n          }]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nThe \n#each\n keyword will iterate through the expression that comes after it (\nmembers\n) and generate a JSON array from the result, ending up with the final JSON markup we saw at the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n2. Conditional (#if/#elseif/#else)\n\n\nConditionals are used to conditionally render their children only when the expression evaluates to \ntrue\n.\n\n\nConditionals take the form of an \narray\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe parser walks through the array sequentially\n\n\nExecutes each conditional expression\n\n\nAnd Renders the child JSON of the first conditional expression that evaluates to \ntrue\n\n\n\n\nsyntax\n\n\nConditionals take the following format.\n\n\n[\n  {\n    \"{{#if (EXPRESSION A)}}\": (JSON)\n  },\n  {\n    \"{{#elseif (EXPRESSION B)}}\": (JSON)\n  }\n  {\n    \"{{#else (EXPRESSION C)}}\": (JSON)\n  }\n]\n\n\n\nThe template will walk through the items in the array sequentially until it encounters an conditional expression that's true. Then it will only render its child JSON.\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n#elseif\n and \n#else\n are optional.\n\n\nif no conditional expression evaluates to \ntrue\n, nothing gets rendered.\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nLet's say we are are trying to render the following return value (\n$jason\n):\n\n\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"name\": \"Homer\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nWhat happens when we run above data through the following template? \n\n\n{\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": [\n        {\n            \"{{#if $jason.data.name=='Bart'}}\": \"Ay Caramba!\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"{{#elseif $jason.data.name=='Homer'}}\": \"Donuts...\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n\nIt will render the following result:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"label\",\n  \"text\": \"Donuts...\"\n}\n\n\n\n3. \"this\"\n\n\nthis\n is a javascript keyword used to refer to the current context. Let's look at what that means:\n\n\nFor example we want to generate this JSON using \n#each\n:\n\n\n[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": \"Homer\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": \"Marge\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": \"Lisa\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": \"Bart\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": \"Maggie\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n\nIf our data looks like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"members\": [{\"name\": \"Homer\"}, {\"name\": \"Marge\"}, {\"name\": \"Lisa\"}, {\"name\": \"Bart\"}, {\"name\": \"Maggie\"}]\n}\n\n\n\nWe can write the following template:\n\n\n{\n  \"{{#each members}}\": {\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": \"{{name}}\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nBut what if it looked like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"members\": [\"Homer\", \"Marge\", \"Lisa\", \"Bart\", \"Maggie\"]\n}\n\n\n\nNow we're lost. Since each individual element in the \nmembers\n array is just a string instead of an object, \nwe need some way to refer to the object itself\n.\n\n\nThis is where \nthis\n comes in. To handle this situation we can write the following template:\n\n\n{\n  \"{{#each members}}\": {\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": \"{{this}}\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nNon-JSON\n\n\nLet's take a look at how non-JSON (CSV, RSS, HTML) templating works:\n\n\nCSV\n\n\nWhen you have a raw CSV content, you can parse it into JSON format before feeding it into a template.\n\n\nTo do this, use \n$convert.csv\n\n\nHere's a functional example\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\nWhen you have an RSS content, you can parse it into JSON format before feeding it into a template.\n\n\nTo do this, use \n$convert.rss\n\n\nHere's a functional example\n\n\n\n\nHTML\n\n\nUnlike other formats like CSV and RSS, Jasonette implements a separate HTML template engine, so we don't need to parse HTML into JSON.\n\n\nInstead, we convert HTML DOM elements into JSON, using the built-in \nHTML to JSON parser\n, which is built on top of \nCheerio library\n, which has similar syntax to \njQuery\n\n\nHow to use\n\n\nStep 1. Make a \n$network.request\n\n\nIt starts with an HTML content. You can fetch HTML content by making \n$network.request\n calls with \ndata_type\n of \nhtml\n, like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n        \"options\": {\n          \"url\": \"http://www.techmeme.com/river\",\n          \"data_type\": \"html\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nStep 2. \n$render\n as html\n\n\nIn order to render it using the html parser, you need to call \n$render\n with \ndata_type\n of \nhtml\n:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n        \"options\": {\n          \"url\": \"http://www.techmeme.com/river\",\n          \"data_type\": \"html\"\n        },\n        \"success\": {\n          \"type\": \"$render\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"type\": \"html\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nStep 3. Use jQuery syntax to parse and render\n\n\nThe HTML template engine automatically sets the \nbody\n element as \n$jason\n.\n\n\nFrom there we can use the \njQuery\n syntax to parse and render content:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n        \"options\": {\n          \"url\": \"http://www.techmeme.com/river\",\n          \"data_type\": \"html\"\n        },\n        \"success\": {\n          \"type\": \"$render\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"type\": \"html\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          \"sections\": [\n            {\n              \"items\": {\n                \"{{#each $jason.find('tr.ritem')}}\": {\n                  \"type\": \"vertical\",\n                  \"components\": [\n                    {\n                      \"type\": \"label\",\n                      \"text\": \"{{$(this).find('td \n a').text()}}\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                      \"type\": \"label\",\n                      \"text\": \"{{$(this).find('cite').text()}}\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                      \"type\": \"label\",\n                      \"text\": \"{{$(this).find('td').first().text() + '  ' + $(this).closest('table').prev().text()}}\"\n                    }\n                  ],\n                  \"href\": {\n                    \"view\": \"web\",\n                    \"url\": \"{{$(this).find('td \n a').attr('href')}}\"\n                  }\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nHere's a functional example\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 When to use templates\n\n\nNormally you can just return a static JSON document from the server and Jason would do its job to render it. However sometimes you may want to dynamically render the view.\n\n\nHere are some cases where using a template makes sense:\n\n\n\n\nMake a separate network request for data, then render the response\n\n\nDynamically render local data\n\n\nDynamically render data generated from device sensors\n\n\nSeparate data from template for less redundancy\n\n\n\n\nLet's take a look at each:\n\n\n\n\n1. Separate data from view\n\n\nMake a separate network request for data, then render the response\nFor example here's a JSON markup that renders a list of labels:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n    },\n    \"body\": {\n      \"sections\": [{\n        \"items\": [{\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 1\"\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 2\"\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 3\"\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 4\"\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 5\"\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 6\"\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 7\"\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 8\"\n        }]\n      }]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the \n\"type\": \"label\"\n part is repeated for each item.\n\n\nInstead of this static JSON, we can use a template/data approach:\n\n\n\n\nReturn a \nbody template\n.\n\n\nMake a separate network request on \n$load\n just to fetch the data.\n\n\nRender the fetched data using the body template.\n\n\n\n\nHere's what it looks like:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"$load\": {\n          \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"url\": \"https://jasonclient.org/rownames.json\"\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$render\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          \"sections\": [{\n            \"items\": {\n              \"{{#each $jason.result}}\": {\n                \"type\": \"label\",\n                \"text\": \"This is row {{row_name}}\"\n              }\n            }\n          }]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice there's no \nbody\n under \n$jason\n here (\n$jason.body\n). It's because we're going to dynamically generate the body using the body template inside \ntemplates\n (\n$jason.head.templates.body\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso notice the \nactions\n attribute contains a $load attribute\n, so this will be triggered as soon as the view loads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo putting all these together, here's what's going on:\n\n\n\n\nThe Jason app loads the JSON shown above, from our server.\n\n\nThere's no \nbody\n attribute so nothing is rendered on the screen by default. However, notice there's a \nbody\n attribute under \ntemplates\n. This is the template that will be rendered as the \nbody\n later.\n\n\nImmediately after the view loads, the \n$load\n action gets automatically triggered by the system.\n\n\n\n\n$load\n makes a \n$network.request\n call with the url specified. We will need to return the following data from the API:\n\n\n{\n    \"result\": [{\n      \"row_name\": \"1\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"2\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"3\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"4\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"5\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"6\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"7\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"8\"\n    }]\n  }\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce \n$network.request\n succeeds, its \nsuccess\n action gets executed next. In this case it's \n$render\n.\n\n\n\n\n$render\n draws the view \nusing the \nbody\n template and the data from the network request\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe result is the same as the \noriginal static JSON\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork request to a 3rd party API:\n Let's say we want to build a Twitter client. What we want to do is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFetch the data by making a network request to Twitter API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRender the data using our own template.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstant plug and play:\n Most web development frameworks nowadays come with JSON API right out of the box. This means you can simply write a template and render your own existing API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Local user input\n\n\nDynamically render local data:\n\n\nYou can render templates using any type of data, which includes \nlocal variables\n you can set using form components such as:\n\n\n\n\ntextfield\n\n\ntextarea\n\n\nsearch\n\n\netc.\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n Below, we render the label using a local variable named \nmessage\n, which is automatically set whenever the \ntextfield\n value changes. \nNote that there is no top level \nbody\n element after \nhead\n.\n Instead we have a \nbody\n template, which will be rendered into body whenever we call the \n$render\n action. \n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"$load\": {\n          \"type\": \"$render\"\n        },\n        \"$pull\": {\n          \"type\": \"$render\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          ...\n          \"items\": [\n            {\n              \"type\": \"textfield\",\n              \"name\": \"message\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"label\"\n              \"text\": {{$get.message}}\"\n            }\n          ]\n          ...\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n3. Device API generated data\n\n\nDynamically render data generated from device APIs\n\n\n\n\ngeolocation\n\n\naddressbook\n\n\ncamera\n\n\ntimer\n\n\netc.\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n Below, we access the geolocation device sensor and render its result. Since our server has no knowledge of the device sensor data, templates are the only way to go in this case.\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"$load\": {\n          \"type\": \"$geo.get\",\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$render\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          ...\n          \"items\": [\n            {\n              \"type\": \"label\"\n              \"text\": {{$jason.coord}}\"\n            }\n          ]\n          ...\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n4. Reduce redundancy\n\n\nSeparate data from template for less redundancy\n\n\nSometimes you simply want to separate view from model to avoid lots of code redundancy. See the below \ndata\n section for details.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 What can be rendered\n\n\n1. Inline data\n\n\nThe \nhead.data\n attribute is used to automatically fill in the \nbody\n template if one exists.\n\n\nWhen a view loads,\n\n\n\n\nJasonette looks at \n$jason.head.data\n and \n$jason.head.templates.body\n.\n\n\nIf both exist, it dynamically generates the view using the data and the template, and inserts it into \n$jason.body\n.\n\n\n\n\nHere's a Jason markup \nwithout\n a template/data. As you can see, the label items mostly repeat, except for the \ntext\n attribute.\n\n\n{\n  ...\n  \"body\": {\n    \"sections\": [\n      \"items\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"Ethan\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"color\": \"#000000\",\n            \"size\": \"14\",\n            \"font\": \"HelveticaNeue-Bold\",\n            \"padding\": \"10\",\n            \"background\": \"rgba(0,0,0,0.5)\",\n            \"width\": \"300\",\n            \"height\": \"100\"\n          }\n        }\n        ...\n        {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"John\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"color\": \"#000000\",\n            \"size\": \"14\",\n            \"font\": \"HelveticaNeue-Bold\",\n            \"padding\": \"10\",\n            \"background\": \"rgba(0,0,0,0.5)\",\n            \"width\": \"300\",\n            \"height\": \"100\"\n          }\n        }\n        {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"Samantha\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"color\": \"#000000\",\n            \"size\": \"14\",\n            \"font\": \"HelveticaNeue-Bold\",\n            \"padding\": \"10\",\n            \"background\": \"rgba(0,0,0,0.5)\",\n            \"width\": \"300\",\n            \"height\": \"100\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nUsing template/data, we can reduce it down to:\n\n\n{\n  \"head\": {\n    \"data\": {\n      \"names\": [\"Ethan\", ..., \"John\", \"Samantha\"]\n    },\n    \"templates\": {\n      \"body\": {\n        \"sections\": [{\n          \"items\": {\n            \"{{#each names}}\": {\n              \"type\": \"label\",\n              \"text\": \"Ethan\",\n              \"style\": {\n                \"color\": \"#000000\",\n                \"size\": \"14\",\n                \"font\": \"HelveticaNeue-Bold\",\n                \"padding\": \"10\",\n                \"background\": \"rgba(0,0,0,0.5)\",\n                \"width\": \"300\",\n                \"height\": \"100\"\n              }\n            }\n          }]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n2. Return value of an action\n\n\nBut templates really shine when you use it to render dynamic data, produced by running some action on the device.\n\n\nThis is essential, since your server has no knowledge of what it should render if the data to render is a result of user interaction.\n\n\nSee here\n for details.\n\n\n3. Manually specify data\n\n\nThis is rarely needed, but sometimes we need a way to manually specify data for the \n$render\n action.\n\n\nSee here\n for details.",

We want to shorten this so that we don't have to rewrite  \"type\": \"label\"  for every item.  First, we need to declare a data attribute ( Learn more about  head.data ):  {\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"data\": {\n        \"members\": [\n          { \"name\": \"Homer\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Marge\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Lisa\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Bart\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Maggie\" }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}  Then we will declare a  body  template that will iterate through this  members  array and turn each into renderable item.  {\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"data\": {\n        \"members\": [\n          { \"name\": \"Homer\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Marge\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Lisa\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Bart\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Maggie\" }\n        ]\n      },\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          \"sections\": [{\n            \"items\": {\n              \"{{#each members}}\": {\n                \"type\": \"label\",\n                \"text\": \"{{name}}\"\n              }\n          }]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}  The  #each  keyword will iterate through the expression that comes after it ( members ) and generate a JSON array from the result, ending up with the final JSON markup we saw at the beginning.",

Instead of this static JSON, we can use a template/data approach:   Return a  body template .  Make a separate network request on  $load  just to fetch the data.  Render the fetched data using the body template.   Here's what it looks like:  {\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"$load\": {\n          \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"url\": \"https://jasonclient.org/rownames.json\"\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$render\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          \"sections\": [{\n            \"items\": {\n              \"{{#each $jason.result}}\": {\n                \"type\": \"label\",\n                \"text\": \"This is row {{row_name}}\"\n              }\n            }\n          }]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}    Notice there's no  body  under  $jason  here ( $jason.body ). It's because we're going to dynamically generate the body using the body template inside  templates  ( $jason.head.templates.body ).    Also notice the  actions  attribute contains a $load attribute , so this will be triggered as soon as the view loads.    So putting all these together, here's what's going on:   The Jason app loads the JSON shown above, from our server.  There's no  body  attribute so nothing is rendered on the screen by default. However, notice there's a  body  attribute under  templates . This is the template that will be rendered as the  body  later.  Immediately after the view loads, the  $load  action gets automatically triggered by the system.   $load  makes a  $network.request  call with the url specified. We will need to return the following data from the API:  {\n    \"result\": [{\n      \"row_name\": \"1\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"2\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"3\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"4\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"5\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"6\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"7\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"8\"\n    }]\n  }    Once  $network.request  succeeds, its  success  action gets executed next. In this case it's  $render .   $render  draws the view  using the  body  template and the data from the network request .   The result is the same as the  original static JSON    Network request to a 3rd party API:  Let's say we want to build a Twitter client. What we want to do is:    Fetch the data by making a network request to Twitter API.    Render the data using our own template.    Instant plug and play:  Most web development frameworks nowadays come with JSON API right out of the box. This means you can simply write a template and render your own existing API.",

(No, really, please someone write an extension.)\n\n\nIntegrate Jasonette with existing code:\n Already have your own app code? Plug in Jasonette to your existing app with just a few lines!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtension vs. Integration\n\n\nBoth extending and integrating involve writing native iOS code.

If it's useful enough it may even be integrated into the main codebase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrating with Jasonette\n means you already have existing code and are using Jasonette only partially. This means:\n\n\n\n\nYou can start using Jasonette in your existing app instantly, without re-writing anything. Just a few lines of code necessary.\n\n\nYou will be able to take advantage of all of Jasonette's power whenever you use the Jasonette view.\n\n\nThe only drawback is you can't control your own non-Jasonette code with JSON (obviously)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtending Jasonette is the recommended way in most cases,\n since it requires very little additional effort, but automatically comes with the power to control your own custom native modules via JSON.\n\n\n\n\n\u2605  Extension\n\n\nLet's jump into writing extensions! There are two things you can extend: \nComponents\n and \nActions\n\n\n1. Extend UI Components\n\n\nJasonette comes with various \nUI components\n right out of the box, but you can easily build your own native component if you need to. Just follow the instructions below to write your component class, and you will instantly be able to summon your component within the \nJasonette layout system\n simply by describing in JSON.\n\n\n1.1. How to write a UI Component class\n\n\nAll you need to do is write a class with a single builder method that returns a \nUIView\n subclass. Here's how:\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. Create a \nJasonComponent\n subclass\n\n\nThe example below demonstrates how to create a \nmap\n component.\n\n\nJust remember the following rules:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a class that inherits from \nJasonComponent.h\n.\n\n\nThe class name should follow this convention: \nJason(COMPONENT_NAME)Component\n\n\nOnly the first character of the COMPONENT_NAME should be capitalized\n\n\n\n\nSo, to create a \nmap\n component:\n\n\n\n\nwe create a subclass of \nJasonComponent\n\n\nAnd name it \nJasonMapComponent\n (Notice the capitalization).\n\n\nWe also import \nMapKit\n since we will need to access the iOS MapKit API.\n\n\n\n\nHere's the result:\n\n\n// JasonMapComponent.h\n#import \"JasonComponent.h\"\n#import \nMapKit/MapKit.h\n\n@interface JasonMapComponent : JasonComponent \nMKMapViewDelegate\n\n@end\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Implement the builder method\n\n\nYou only need to implement a single class method:\n\n\n+ (UIView\n)build:(NSDictionary\n)json withOptions:(NSDictionary*)options\n.\n\n\nBasically it's a builder method that takes a JSON snippet in NSDictionary format and creates a UIView subclass. It can be a UILabel, UIButton, or whatever, as long as it's a subclass of \nUIView\n.\n\n\nCustomize it using the info passed in from the \njson\n parameter, and finally return the \nUIView\n once you're done.\n\n\nHere's what the most primitive version would look like:\n\n\n// JasonMapComponent.m\n@implementation JasonMapComponent\n+ (UIView *)build:(NSDictionary *)json withOptions:(NSDictionary *)options{\n  MKMapView *mapView = [[MKMapView alloc] init];\n  return mapView;\n}\n@end\n\n\n\nThis works since \nMKMapView\n is a subclass of \nUIView\n.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. And that's it!\n\n\nThis is seriously all we need to do! Our map component is now 100% powered by JSON, just like rest of the \nJasonette components\n.\n\n\nHere's an example of how we would summon our \nmap\n component.\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"vertical\",\n  \"components\": [\n    { \"type\": \"label\", \"text\": \"This is a map\" },\n    { \"type\": \"map\" }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\nSo how does this work behind the scenes? Whenever Jasonette encounters a component description, \n\n\n\n\nIt looks at its \ntype\n first. Here we see the \n{\"type\": \"map\"}\n, so it's a \nmap\n component.\n\n\nBased on this, it looks for a class named \nJasonMapComponent\n (Remember the naming convention is: \nJason(COMPONENT_NAME_WITH_FIRST_LETTER_CAPITALIZED)Component\n\n\nWhen it finds the component class, it runs its \nbuild:withOptions:\n method to finally build the component.\n\n\n\n\nOf course, this is a simplified version of how the actual \nmap\n component works. In reality the \njson\n object would contain more information than just \n{ \"type\": \"map\" }\n. It may look something like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"map\",\n  \"region\": {\n    \"coord\": \"40.7409395,-74.0083886\",\n    \"width\": \"50\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nAll you need to do is take this, parse it, and customize the \nmapView\n object before returning, like the comment below.\n\n\n// JasonMapComponent.m\n@implementation JasonMapComponent\n+ (UIView *)build:(NSDictionary *)json withOptions:(NSDictionary *)options{\n  MKMapView *mapView = [[MKMapView alloc] init];\n  /*\n    Do some customization with the 'json' argument here.\n  */\n  return mapView;\n}\n@end\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2. Tips on writing component classes\n\n\n\n\nA. Keep it stateless and self contained\n\n\nThese component builder classes and methods are stateless by design. That's why the \nbuild:withOptions:\n method is \na class method\n that simply takes a \nNSDictionary\n as input and returns a \nUIView\n as output.\n\n\n\n\nB. Use class methods\n\n\nLike mentioned above, Jasonette requires that all the component methods are implemented as class methods.\n\n\nYou may ask \"But there's a delegate method I'm trying to use for handling events, and it's an instance method only. How do I deal with this?\".\n\n\nWell, in objective-c, classes are also objects, so you can in fact call them the same way you call an instance method.\n\n\nJust switch out the instance method with its class method version\n (use \n+\n instead of \n-\n at the beginning of the method definition), like below:\n\n\n// JasonMapComponent.m\n@implementation JasonMapComponent\n+ (UIView *)build:(NSDictionary *)json withOptions:(NSDictionary *)options{\n  MKMapView *mapView = [[MKMapView alloc] init];\n\n  /*\n    Do some customization with the 'json' argument here\n  */\n\n  mapView.delegate = self;\n\n  return mapView;\n}\n\n+ (void)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView didUpdateUserLocation:(MKUserLocation *)userLocation{\n  /*\n    Handle the event\n  */\n}\n@end\n\n\n\nHere we implement\n\n\n+ (void)mapView:(MKMapView \n)mapView didUpdateUserLocation:(MKUserLocation \n)userLocation\n\n\nto handle MapKit events.\n\n\n\n\nC. Take advantage of the built-in stylize method\n\n\nA lot of style attributes such as background, width, height, corner_radius, opacity, etc. are common across various types of components.\n\n\nJasonComponent\n class has a built-in method that you can utilize to automatically apply these styles. It's called:\n\n\n+ (void) stylize: (NSDictionary \n)json component: (UIView \n)component\n.\n\n\nJust by calling this method once, you can take advantage of all the following style attributes right out of the box!\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"mycustomitem\",\n  \"style\": {\n    \"width\": \"...\",\n    \"height\": \"...\",\n    \"opacity\": \"...\",\n    \"background\": \"...\",\n    \"color\": \"...\",\n    \"corner_radius\": \"...\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nHere's an example code that creates a UIView, runs it through the built-in \nstylize\n, and then applies additional custom styles.\n\n\n+ (UIView *)build:(NSDictionary *)json withOptions:(NSDictionary *)options{\n  // Build some component here\n  UIView *component = [[UIView alloc] init];\n\n  /*\n  customize the component here\n  */\n\n  // run it through the default stylize method\n  [self stylize: json component: component];\n\n  // Add your own custom styling logic here, on top of the default styling above\n  if(style[@\"rotate\"] {\n    // some custom styling logic ....\n  }\n\n  return component;\n}\n\n\n\nYou don't even need to include an additional file, since the \nstylize\n method comes for free just by subclassing \nJasonComponent\n\n\n\n\n2. Extend Actions\n\n\nJust like components, you can easily write your own native \naction\n modules and call them using 100% JSON syntax.\n\n\nOne thing to keep in mind: \nAction classes contain a collection of related action methods\n, which is why most actions are namepaced as \n$(GROUPNAME).(METHODNAME)\n when you call it. \n\n\nFor example \nJasonNetworkAction\n class--an action class that deals with network requests--contains multiple methods: \nrequest\n, \nupload\n, \nauth\n, \nunauth\n. Each method can be invoked by Jasonette using \n$network.request\n, \n$network.auth\n, \n$network.upload\n, and \n$network.unauth\n actions.\n\n\n\n\n2.1. How to write an Action\n\n\nLet's try writing an action class (\n$util\n) and one of its methods which displays a banner (\n$util.banner\n).\n\n\nWe woulid like to parse this JSON markup:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"title\": \"Hello\",\n    \"description\": \"Hello world!\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nto display a notification banner that looks like this:\n\n\n[IMAGE]\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. Create an Action Class\n\n\nThree rules for writing your action class:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a class that inherits from \nJasonAction.h\n.\n\n\nThe class name should follow the following convention: \nJason(GROUP_NAME)Action\n\n\nOnly the first character of the GROUP_NAME should be capitalized\n\n\n\n\nTo create a class that responds to \n$util.banner\n, we first need a class for the \nutil\n group. Following the rule, we need to create a \nJasonUtilAction\n, which inherits from \nJasonAction\n:\n\n\n//  JasonUtilAction.h\n#import \"JasonAction.h\"\n@interface JasonUtilAction : JasonAction\n@end\n\n//  JasonUtilAction.m\n#import \"JasonUtilAction.h\"\n@implementation JasonUtilAction\n@end\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Write an Action Method\n\n\nThree rules for naming an action method:\n\n\n\n\nIt should be an \ninstance method\n.\n\n\nIts return value should be \nvoid\n.\n\n\nWhatever you name your method will respond to an action call \n$[GROUP_NAME].[METHOD_NAME]\n.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, to handle \n$util.banner\n action we need to implement an \ninstance method\n, and its name should be \nbanner\n, like this:\n\n\n//  JasonUtilAction.h\n#import \"JasonAction.h\"\n@interface JasonUtilAction : JasonAction\n@end\n\n//  JasonUtilAction.m\n#import \"JasonUtilAction.h\"\n@implementation JasonUtilAction\n- (void)banner{\n    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\n        [[TWMessageBarManager sharedInstance] showMessageWithTitle: @\"Banner Title\"\n                                                       description: @\"Here goes banner description\"\n                                                              type: TWMessageBarMessageTypeInfo];\n    });\n    [[Jason client] success];\n}\n@end\n\n\n\nThis will display a banner when the following action is triggered\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$util.banner\"\n}\n\n\n\nNotice the \n[[Jason client] success]\n line. This is how your action signals that its job is over. More on this later.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Pass arguments to the action\n\n\nIn the previous example we hardcoded the title and description for the banner. But a component that displays the same text all the time is not cool. Instead we want to pass some arguments and have them customize how the action is run. For example, we want the \n$util.banner\n action to take an \noptions\n attribute and build a custom banner, like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"title\": \"Yo\",\n    \"description\": \"Dawg\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nTo access the \noptions\n attribute of an action, simply use \nself.options\n inside the method, like this:\n\n\n//  JasonUtilAction.h\n#import \"JasonAction.h\"\n@interface JasonUtilAction : JasonAction\n@end\n\n//  JasonUtilAction.m\n#import \"JasonUtilAction.h\"\n@implementation JasonUtilAction\n- (void)banner{\n\n    // Extract title and description out of self.options!\n    NSString *title = self.options[@\"title\"];\n    NSString *description = self.options[@\"description\"];\n\n    // Use the custom title and description instead of hardcoding!\n    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\n        [[TWMessageBarManager sharedInstance] showMessageWithTitle: title\n                                                       description: description\n                                                              type: TWMessageBarMessageTypeInfo];\n    });\n    [[Jason client] success];\n}\n@end\n\n\n\nYou don't need to define \nself.options\n anywhere because you get it for free just by subclassing \nJasonAction\n.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. End the action\n\n\nYou MUST explicitly signal the end of each action when implementing an action method\n.\n\n\nThis is because we can't assume that all actions end when they reach the last line. \nSome actions trigger asynchronous background tasks, and we need to wait until that task is over.\n \n\n\nTo signal the end of an action we call:\n \n\n\n[[Jason client] success];\n\n\nThis command will:\n\n\n\n\nFinish the current action\n\n\nSee if the current action has a \nsuccess\n attribute, and if it does, proceed to call that action.\n\n\n\n\nHere's an example where we make a network request, and then display a success banner when it succeeds:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"https://imagejason.herokuapp.com\",\n    \"method\": \"post\"\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"title\": \"Success!\",\n      \"description\": \"Successfully posted!\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nThe implementation for \n$network.request\n may look something like this:\n\n\n//  JasonNetworkAction.m\n#import \"JasonNetworkAction.h\"\n@implementation JasonNetworkAction\n...\n- (void)request{\n  AFHTTPSessionManager *manager = [AFHTTPSessionManager manager];\n  ... \n  dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue( DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^(void){\n    [manager POST:url parameters:parameters progress:^(NSProgress * _Nonnull downloadProgress) {\n    } success:^(NSURLSessionDataTask * _Nonnull task, id  _Nullable responseObject) {\n      dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\n        [[Jason client] success];\n      });\n    } failure:^(NSURLSessionDataTask * _Nullable task, NSError * _Nonnull error) {\n    }];\n  });\n}\n... \n@end\n\n\n\nNotice how we call the \n[[Jason client] success]\n line \ninside the \"success\" block, instead of the last line of the method\n. This is because the network request task runs asynchronously and the action shouldn't end until it reaches inside the \nsuccess\n block.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5. Handle exceptions\n\n\nWe can end an action with \n[[Jason client] success]\n when everything goes as expected. But what if something goes wrong? We still need to end the action but also run an exception handling logic, instead of going on to the next action.\n\n\nFor example, the \n$network.request\n may fail because there's no Internet connection. To handle these exceptions, Jason actions have another attribute called \nerror\n, as demonstrated below:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"https://imagejason.herokuapp.com\",\n    \"method\": \"post\"\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"title\": \"Success!\",\n      \"description\": \"Successfully fetched!\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"error\": {\n    \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"title\": \"ERROR!!!!\",\n      \"description\": \"Uh oh, something went wrong!\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nTo signal that the action has ended with an error when we implement action methods, we call:\n\n\n[[Jason client] error];\n.\n\n\nLet's take the previous code and add that line:\n\n\n//  JasonNetworkAction.m\n#import \"JasonNetworkAction.h\"\n@implementation JasonNetworkAction\n...\n- (void)request{\n  AFHTTPSessionManager *manager = [AFHTTPSessionManager manager];\n  ... \n  dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue( DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^(void){\n    [manager POST:url parameters:parameters progress:^(NSProgress * _Nonnull downloadProgress) {\n    } success:^(NSURLSessionDataTask * _Nonnull task, id  _Nullable responseObject) {\n      dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\n        [[Jason client] success];\n      });\n    } failure:^(NSURLSessionDataTask * _Nullable task, NSError * _Nonnull error) {\n      dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\n        [[Jason client] error];\n      });\n    }];\n  });\n}\n... \n@end\n\n\n\nThe code is mostly same as the previous one, except we've added the \n[[Jason client] error];\n inside the \nfailure\n block of the task.\n\n\n\n\nStep 6. Set the return value\n\n\nIn many cases we want to run an action, take its output, and pass it to another action. \n\n\nHere, we run a \n$geo.get\n action, and then display its return value as an alert using \n$util.alert\n.\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$geo.get\",\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"title\": \"Current Location\",\n      \"description\": \"{{$jason.coord}}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nNotice how we use a variable called \n$jason\n. This is how return values work in Jasonette--if an action has a return value, it passes it along to the next action as a variable named \n$jason\n.\n\n\nTo end an action with a return value, we call:\n\n\n[[Jason client] success: response]\n\n\nTo support the JSON markup above, the \n$geo.get\n action implementation should look like this:\n\n\n// JasonGeoAction.m\n#import \"JasonGeoAction.h\"\n@implementation JasonGeoAction\n- (void)get{\n\n  /*\n     Implement some location sensor logic that populates the 'currentLocation' variable\n  */\n\n  NSString *coord = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%g,%g\", currentLocation.coordinate.latitude, currentLocation.coordinate.longitude];\n  [[Jason client] success: @{@\"coord\": coord}];\n}\n@end\n\n\n\nHere we end \n$geo.get\n with an object \n@{@\"coord\": coord}\n. As mentioned above, this object will be accessible as \n$jason\n in the next action. This is how the \n$util.banner\n action can dynamically build itself using the\n$jason.coord\n value.\n\n\n\n\n\u2605  Integration\n\n\nJasonette by default covers most of what you need to build any app you can imagine. Also you can even extend its \nactions\n and \ncomponents\n, like we discussed above. \n\n\nHowever if you already have an existing code and just want to integrate with Jasonette here and there, that's cool too! You don't have to throw away all your existing code and re-write everything just to take advantage of Jasonette!\n\n\nHow it works\n\n\nBasically, \nJasonViewController\n is a self contained class whose only requirement is that you set its \nurl\n before presenting it. This means you can integrate Jasonette just like using any other view controllers in your project.\n\n\n\n\n\u2605 REMEMBER - Obviously, you will need to either copy all your existing project files into Jasonette project, or Jasonette files into your own project, before you do this.\n\n\n\n\n1. Non-Jasonette =\n Jasonette\n\n\nHere's how you can open a \nJasonViewController\n from your own viewcontroller\u2014it's same as opening any other viewcontrollers.\n\n\nA. First, include JasonViewController.h in your viewcontroller\n\n\n#import \"JasonViewController.h\"\n\n\n\nB. Open with push transition:\n\n\nTo open the \nJasonViewController\n with a push transition, do this:\n\n\nJasonViewController *vc = [[JasonViewController alloc] init];\nvc.url = @\"https://jasonbase.com/things/jYJ.json\";\n[self.navigationViewController pushViewController:vc animated:YES];\n\n\n\nC. Open with modal transition:\n\n\nTo open \nJasonViewController\n as a modal, do this:\n\n\nJasonViewController *vc = [[JasonViewController alloc] init];\nvc.url = @\"https://jasonbase.com/things/jYJ.json\";\nUINavigationController *nav = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:vc];\n[self.navigationController presentViewController:nav animated:YES completion:nil];\n\n\n\nAnd that's it for Non-Jasonette =\n Jasonette view transition! Nothing special, just a regular viewcontroller.\n\n\n\n\n2. Jasonette =\n Non-Jasonette\n\n\nThis one's a bit different, since we are transitioning from a \nJasonViewController\n to your custom viewcontroller. \n\n\n\n\n\u2605 REMEMBER - Everything that happens on the Jasonette side is JSON powered.\n\n\nWhich means we need to handle the transition using JSON.\n\n\n\n\nHere's how to transition from a Jasonette view to your custom non-Jasonette view:\n\n\nOption A. Using Storyboard\n\n\nIt works exactly the same as normal Jasonette transitions--simply attach an \nhref\n and set its \nview\n attribute.\n\n\nYou need to name it like this:\n\n\n[STORYBOARD NAME].[STORYBOARD IDENTIFIER FOR THE VIEWCONTROLLER]\n\n\nFor example, to transition to a viewcontroller which has a storyboard ID of \nPaymentViewController\n on a storyboard named \nMainStoryboard.storyboard\n, we do the following:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"label\",\n  \"text\": \"Make a payment\",\n  \"href\": {\n    \"view\": \"MainStoryboard.PaymentViewController\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nOption B. Not using Storyboard\n\n\nIf you don't use storyboard, you can simply enter the viewcontroller's class name. For example, to transition to a \nPaymentViewController\n class,\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"label\",\n  \"text\": \"Make a payment\",\n  \"href\": {\n    \"view\": \"PaymentViewController\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nPassing arguments to your viewcontroller\n\n\nLet's say we now want to pass some arguments to the \nPaymentViewController\n. Here's how we can achieve this:\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. Add an \nNSDictionary\n property called \njason\n to your custom viewcontroller\n\n\nFor example if we wanted our \nPaymentViewController\n to support this feature, we will need to add an \nNSDictionary *jason\n property to the class, like this:\n\n\n// PaymentViewController.h\n#import \nUIKit/UIKit.h\n\n@interface PaymentViewController : UIViewController  \n  ....\n  @property (nonatomic, strong) NSDictionary *jason\n  ....\n@end\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Pass the \noptions\n attribute inside \nhref\n.\n\n\nAnd we're all set! We can now start passing arguments to the \nPaymentViewController\n using the JSON syntax! Here's an example:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"label\",\n  \"text\": \"Make a payment\",\n  \"href\": {\n    \"view\": \"MainStoryboard.PaymentViewController\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"product_id\": \"3kzf9ela\",\n      \"user_id\": \"3kzf9ela\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Use the \njason\n property in your viewcontroller\n\n\nNow that our \nPaymentViewController\n is receiving the \noptions\n object as \njason\n, we just need to make use of it in the implementation. Example:\n\n\n// PaymentViewController.m\n#import \"PaymentViewController.h\"\n@implementation PaymentViewController\n  ....\n  - (void)viewDidLoad {\n    [super viewDidLoad];\n    NSString *product_id = self.jason[@\"product_id\"];\n    NSString *user_id = self.jason[@\"user_id\"];\n\n    /*\n      Use product_id and user_id for your custom logic!\n    */\n  }\n  ....\n@end",
