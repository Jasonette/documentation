Learn\n\n\nWatch the 2 videos below and you'll have learned everything you need to know to get started.\n\n\nThe videos were shot using an iPhone, but it works exactly the same for Android.\n\n\n\n\nA. Do you know JSON?\n\n\nBefore we dive in, do you know JSON? If not, just check out \nthis tutorial\n, takes 2 minutes.\n\n\n\n\nB. Get a JSON server\n\n\nYou'll be serving your entire app from a server, so you will need somewhere to host JSON, just like you need somewhere to host websites. There are many ways to do this:\n\n\n\n\n1. Jasonbase.com (https://www.jasonbase.com)\n\n\n[Recommended]\n A JSON hosting service created by \n@gliechtenstein\n while building Jasonette because there was no easy way to host, edit, and serve JSON online instantly. This is the site used in the tutorial videos. Feel free to use this for your Jasonette apps. \nIt's FREE.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Code hosting or pastebin sites\n\nYou can also use \nGithub\n or \nPastebin\n. Not really recommended for development because these sites are \nNOT built for this type of usage\n. They actually discourage you from using them as API endpoint. Furthermore, their content is cached so you'll often keep getting old responses whenever you update your JSON content, which is a pain. \nHowever, you can use them AFTER you've finished editing, or use it for open sourcing though. \nHere's an example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Plug into your existing server\n\nYou can skip all this and set up your own web app with a JSON endpoint, or just plug into your existing web app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC. Learn the basics\n\n\nThis video walks you through the basics of Jasonette, such as how it works, how to get started, etc. It was shot using iOS but it basically works the same for Android.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD. Learn JASON syntax\n\n\nThis video teaches you how to actually write a JSON markup to build sophisticated interactive layouts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Learn more (Reference)\n\n\n\n\nAnatomy of a Jason view\n\n\nLearn the basic structure of a JASON view\n\nJust like HTML has basic tags such as body, div, span, li, etc, Jasonette has JSON based tags to describe the structure of a view.\n\n\n\n\nComponents\n\n\nLearn component syntax\n\nComponents are the most basic units of user interface, such as image, label, textarea, button, slider, etc. \n\n\n\nLayout\n\n\nLearn layouts\n\nIn many cases we combine multiple components to construct a unit. We use layouts to do this.\n\n\n\n\nLink multiple views\n\n\nLearn linking\n\nAbove three sections are all you need to know to display content in a view. But what if we want multiple views? We can link them using \nhref\n.\n\n\n\n\nActions\n\n\nLearn actions\n\nActions define a task or a sequence of tasks you wish to run, such as network request, audio play, camera access, geolocation, displaying banners, etc.\n\n\n\n\nTemplates\n\n\nLearn templates\n\nYou can use templates to dynamically render data, such as remote network content, local data, and user input.\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nActual JSON examples you can try out with Jasonette:\n\n\nTry examples here",

Let's get your first Jasonette app on your phone, in 20 seconds! \nInterested in manual setup?\n\n\n\n\n Want to skip the setup and try Jasonette without building your own app? - \nTry Jason.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. DOWNLOAD\n\n\n\nJasonette itself is a pre-built app.\nAll you need to do is download and build with \nXCode\n.\n\n\nGo ahead and download Jasonette, and then unzip.\n\n\n\n Download Jasonette-iOS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. SETUP\n\n\nInitialize by running the \nSetup\n command.\n\n\n\nThis command automatically generates icons and sets the title and the url. \n\n\n\n\n \nBEFORE YOU START:\n Make sure you have the most recent version of XCode! (At least XCode 8) You can download it \nHere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. PLAY\n\n\nConnect your phone and click play on XCode. Done!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2605 Did it work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYES?\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations! You're ready to transform this into your OWN app! Go on to the \ntutorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNO?\n\n\n\n\nCheck troubleshoot section\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManual setup\n\n\nIt is recommended that you use \nthe Setup command\n since it takes care of most of tedious details, but you can also do this manually.\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. Download\n\n\nDownload Jasonette\n and unzip.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Open in XCode\n\n\nGo into the \napp\n folder and open \nJasonette.xcworkspace\n file. \n(warning: Make sure to open the \nxcworkspace\n file, NOT the \nxcodeproj\n file!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Update config attributes and generate icons manually\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet App Name:\n Under the \nConfig\n group, open the \nInfo.plist\n file and change the \nCFBundleName\n attribute.\n\n\nSet Root URL:\n Under the \nConfig\n group, open the \nsettings.plist\n file and change the \nurl\n attribute.\n\n\nGenerate Icon:\n You can try generating app icons using online services like \nmakeappicon.com\n, and \nadd them manually to the project\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. Play\n\n\nConnect your phone and click play on XCode. Done!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitting to the app store\n\n\nThere are a couple of things to keep in mind when submitting to the app store.\n\n\n1. Sign up as Apple Developer\n\n\nYou can test as much as you want without signing up as a developer, you can even put apps on your phone. However when it comes to actually submitting apps, you need to register as a developer. Google \"apple developer\" to learn how to do this.\n\n\n\n\n2. Archive and Upload\n\n\nAssuming you're all ready, you just need to \"archive\" the app first, and then press \"upload to app store\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Uncheck \"Include bitcode\"\n\n\nWhen you press \"upload to app store\", it will show up a confirmation dialog. Uncheck \"Include bitcode\" option here. We do not need Bitcode because Jasonette is already small due to its modularity, and it actually may become larger. In fact including bitcode doesn't work well with Jasonette, so make sure you uncheck this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshoot\n\n\n\u25a0 \"Unknown property attribute 'class'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is known to happen in old versions of XCode. Please upgrade your XCode to the \nlatest version\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 \"No provisioning...\" error\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust press \"Fix Issue\" and sign in with your Apple account\n\n\nIf that doesn't work, read this post\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 \"Signing for \"Jasonette\" requires a development team. Select a development team in the project editor.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the project from XCode.\n\n\nGo to \"General\" section.\n\n\nClick \"Team\" under Signing section.

DOWNLOAD AND UNZIP\n\n\n\nJasonette itself is a pre-built app.\nAll you need to do is download Jasonette and build with \nAndroid Studio\n.\n\n\n\n Download Jasonette-Android\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. LAUNCH ANDROID STUDIO\n\n\nNow launch \nAndroid Studio\n, and select \"Import project\"\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. IMPORT THE PROJECT\n\n\nFind the Jasonette folder you just unzipped and press OK.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. PRESS PLAY\n\n\nJasonette comes with a default demo JSON url embedded. Let's try running it to make sure it works.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5. CONNECT THE PHONE AND RUN\n\n\nIt will show up a dialog that looks like this.\n\n\nHere you can either choose to run it on an emulator or a real device.\n\n\nTo learn how to connect the phone, or how to run it on an emulator, \nread this\n.\n\n\n\n\nStep 6. CUSTOMIZE!\n\n\nNow let's try changing the JSON url so you can turn it into your own app.\n\n\nFirst, click the \"Project\" tab on the left side.\n\n\nThen find \napp\n \n \nres\n \n \nvalues\n \n \nstrings.xml\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Update JSON URL\n\n\nUpdate the \nurl\n property inside \nstrings.xml\n to your own JSON url. That's it! Build and run the app and you'll find that it's turned into your own app!\n\n\nIf you don't have a JSON yet, \nhere are some example apps you can try quickly\n\n\n\n\nB. Update App name\n\n\nBy default the app is named \"Jasonette\". You probably want to change this. From the same \nstrings.xml\n file, change the \napp_name\n value to your desired app name.\n\n\n\n\nC. Update App icon\n\n\nStep 1. Create new Image Asset\n\n\nSelect \napp\n \n \nres\n and right-click to display a context menu. Then select \nNew\n \n \nImage Asset\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Select your image\n\n\nSelect \nimage\n as Asset Type, and select the \npath\n to the image you want to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Confirm and finish\n\n\nIt will display some warning about overwriting existing icon. You're overwriting the default icon with your own so it's natural. Press Finish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD. Update App ID (Important!)\n\n\nThis is important if you want to submit to the play store, since this is the ID that distinguishes one app from another.\n\n\nTo change this ID, go to: \nGradle Scripts\n \n \nbuild.gradle (Module: app)\n, and find the \napplicationId\n attribute.\n\n\nIt should be \ncom.jasonette\n by default.\n\n\n\n\nChange this to your own unique ID. (In this example I've changed it to \ncom.jasonette.seed\n)\n\n\nPress \"Sync Now\" at the top right corner, and rebuild.\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more, \nread this documentation\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2605 Did it work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYES?\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations! You're ready to transform this into your OWN app! Go on to the \ntutorial\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNO?\n\n\n\n\nCheck troubleshoot section\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitting to the play store\n\n\nCheck out this documentation\n to learn how to submit to the play store.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshoot\n\n\nNeed more help?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlack - \n  Come ask quick questions and share tips with other Jasonette users. \nJoin here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForum - \n  Chat messages on Slack tend to flow away, so you may want to ask questions on the forum.

This is called \ninline styling\n since the style attribute is attached to the UI component directly.\n\n\nNow if you look closer, you'll see that each item has exactly the same repeating style.\n\n\nWe can get rid of this redundancy by using \nhead.styles\n:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n      \n\"styles\": {\n        \"styled_row\": {\n          \"font\": \"HelveticaNeue\",\n          \"size\": \"20\",\n          \"color\": \"#ff0000\",\n          \"padding\": \"10\"\n        }\n      }\n\n    },\n    \"body\": {\n      \"sections\": [{\n        \"items\": [{\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 1\",\n          \n\"class\": \"styled_row\"\n\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 2\",\n          \n\"class\": \"styled_row\"\n\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 3\",\n          \n\"class\": \"styled_row\"\n\n        }]\n      }]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nFirst look at each label item. Now the style attributes are gone, but instead we have a \nclass\n value of \nstyled_row\n for each.\n\n\nNow let's look under \n$jason.head.styles\n. You'll see we now have the \nstyled_row\n defined here. The styles registered here will be applied to each UI component whenever its class name is referenced.\n\n\n\n\nhead.actions\n\n\nUsing action registry to define actions\n\n\nYou can define actions under the action registry (\nhead.actions\n) and reuse them through the \ntrigger\n keyword.\n\n\n\n\nhead.templates\n\n\nDeclaring templates\n\n\nYou can dynamically render any data using templates. Templates are registered under \nhead.templates\n\n\n\n\nhead.data\n\n\nUsing inline data for rendering\n\n\nhead.data\n is like an inline database that gets rendered automatically by \nbody\n template if included.\n\n\n\n\n\u2500\u2500 body \u2500\u2500\n\n\nBody contains everything that gets displayed on the screen. A body is made up of the following view elements.\n\n\n{\n    \"$jason\": {\n        \"head\": {\n            ...\n        },\n        \n\"body\": {\n            \"header\": {\n                ...\n            },\n            \"sections\": [\n                { ... },\n                { ... },\n                ...\n            ],\n            \"layers\": [\n                { ... },\n                { ... },\n                ...\n            ],\n            \"footer\": {\n                ...\n            }\n        }\n\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nheader\n represents the top area\n\n\nsections\n represent a scrollable list of items\n\n\nlayers\n represent non-scrolling items\n\n\nfooter\n represents the bottom area\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexamples\n\n\nHere's what each part looks like in a real app:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSections contains a list that can be scrolled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayers are images or labels that stay put on top of everything.\n\n\nYou can also drag/resize/rotate layers depending on how you define them.\n\n\n\n\nbody.ads\n\n\nbody.ads\n describes the banner ads and the interstitial ads on the page\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0  ads\n\n\nUse to show banner and interstitial ads.\nCurrently iOS only, open Android Issue here: \nAd support for Android #22\n\n\nscreenshots\n\n\nBanner ad:\n\n\n\n\nInterstitial ad:\n\n\n\n\nsyntax\n\n\n\u2022 \ntype\n: \n\"admob\"\n\n\n\u2022 \noptions\n: Possible options for the ad\n\n\n\n\ntype\n: \nbanner\n or \ninterstitial\n, for type of ad.\n\n\nunitID\n: AdMob Unit ID.

To enable them, do the following steps:\n\n\n\n\nDownload the latest version of Jasonette from the \nmaster\n branch and unzip: \nmaster branch download\n\n\nDownload CocoaPods from here: https://cocoapods.org/app\n\n\nRun CocoaPods. From the app menu, open \nFile \n Open Podfile\n. Then find the project folder you just unzipped. From the project folder, go into \napp\n folder and you should see a file called \nPodfile\n. Select that file and open it from CocoaPods app. You should see this screen:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncomment \npod 'GoogleMobileAds', '~\n 7.8'\n (By removing the \n#\n character) and press the \ninstall\n button in the top right corner. The install will start, after that you'll see the following screen:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice the green Installing GoogleMobileAds line from above screenshot. That means the library has been successfully installed into the project and you can use it.\n\n\n\n\nNow go to the root folder of your project and run Setup, and go through the setup process just like any other Jasonette project.\n\n\nYou now need to turn on the Ad feature on Xcode. To do this, open \nJasonette \n Config \n Constants.h\n file from in your Xcode workspace (which should have opened after the setup process), Uncomment \n#define ADS 1\n by removing the \n//\n. The result should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that's it! You should now be able to use ads in your project.\n\n\n\n\nbody.header\n\n\nbody.header\n describes the top header bar and its components.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 title\n\n\nThere are two ways to set the title of the header bar:\n\n\n\n\nBasic: Simple text\n\n\nAdvanced: Can be a text or an image\n\n\n\n\nBasic title\n\n\nSimply set the string to change the title on the header bar.\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n    },\n    \"body\": {\n      \"header\": {\n        \"title\": \"[Title goes here]\"\n      },\n      ...\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nThe result:\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced title\n\n\nYou can describe the title in more detail using a \ntitle\n object instead of just a simple string. Here's the syntax:\n\n\n\n\ntype\n: \n\"label\"\n or \n\"image\"\n\n\ntext\n: In case it's a \nlabel\n type, set the text. Same as using the basic title described above.\n\n\nurl\n: In case it's an image, set the image url.\n\n\nstyle\n: In case it's an image we can set the \nwidth\n and the \nheight\n\n\nwidth\n: set the width of the image\n\n\nheight\n: set the height of the image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's an example\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n    },\n    \"body\": {\n      \"header\": {\n        \"title\": {\n          \"type\": \"image\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"width\": \"94\",\n            \"height\": \"27\"\n          },\n          \"url\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jasonette/Instagram-UI-example/master/images/logo.png\"\n        }\n      },\n      ...\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nThe result (See the header title image):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0  search\n\n\nSearch component.

See \nhref reference\n for details.\n\n\n\n\nexample\n\n\nHere's an example:\n\n\n{\n  ...\n  \"sections\": [{\n    \"items\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"label\",\n        \"text\": \"Label only item\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"vertical\",\n        \"components\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"image\",\n            \"url\": \"https://jasonclient.org/img/john.png\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"label\",\n            \"text\": \"John\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"label\",\n            \"text\": \"Doe\"\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"vertical\",\n        \"components\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"image\",\n            \"url\": \"https://jasonclient.org/img/mary.png\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"label\",\n            \"text\": \"Mary\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"label\",\n            \"text\": \"Jane\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }]\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\nWhat's going on above:\n\n\nThis section contains 3 items.\n\n\nThe first one is a \nlabel\n component item (Displays the text \"Label only item\")\n\n\nThe second and third are \nvertical\n layouts, each of which contains one image and two labels.\n\n\n\u25a0 header\n\n\nA header is similar to \nitems\n. Visually it looks the same. However there are some differences:\n\n\n\n\nA header is for \ndisplay purpose\n only.\n\n\nTherefore a header cannot have an \nhref\n, \naction\n, or \nmenu\n attributes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA header functions as a divider between sections.\n\n\nIt sticks to the top as you scroll through the items in its section, until you scroll out of the section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can only have up to 1 header per section.\n\n\nIt's optional.\n\n\n\n\nattributes\n\n\nHere's a list of attributes a header supports (Same as \nitems\n, with an exception of interactive features):\n\n\n\u25a0  \ntype\n: \nvertical\n or \nhorizontal\n in case of layout. A component name in case it's a component item. (for example, \nlabel\n, \nimage\n, \nbutton\n, etc.)\n\n\n\u25a0  \ncomponents\n: child components, in case it's a layout item.\n\n\n\u25a0  \nstyle\n: layout style + item specific style\n\n\n\n\ncolor\n: Set the color of the item's disclosure indicator in case \nhref\n is used.\n\n\nheight\n: Set the height of the item.\n\n\nz_index\n: An integer value (example: \n{\"z_index\": \"-1\"}\n). Set the z-index of the item. (Similar to \nCSS z-index\n)\n\n\nBy default, \nheader\n has a higher \nz_index\n than \nitems\n. That's why the items scroll below the header as they scroll. You can however change that by setting the header's z_index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbody.layers\n\n\nLayers are floating elements that can be configured to be \nresized\n, \ndragged\n, \nrotated\n, and \nreact to actions\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently layers support two types of components:\n\n\n\n\nlabel\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0  type:label\n\n\nFloating labels.\n\n\nattributes\n\n\n\n\ntype\n: \n\"label\"\n\n\ntext\n: the text to display\n\n\naction\n: \naction\n to run on user tap event\n\n\nstyle\n\n\nwidth\n\n\nheight\n\n\npadding\n\n\ntop\n: position from the top of the screen\n\n\nleft\n: position from the left of the screen\n\n\nright\n: position from the right of the screen\n\n\nbottom\n: position from the bottom of the screen\n\n\ncorner_radius\n\n\nfont\n\n\nsize\n\n\nbackground\n\n\ncolor\n\n\nalign\n: text align (\n\"left\"\n | \n\"center\"\n | \n\"right\"\n) Default is \n\"left\"\n\n\nresize\n: resizable when set to \n\"true\"\n (default is false)\n\n\nmove\n: can be dragged around when set to \n\"true\"\n (default is false)\n\n\nrotate\n: can be rotated when set to \n\"true\"\n (default is false)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexample\n\n\n{\n  \"layers\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"label\",\n      \"text\": \"Floating label\",\n      \"style\": {\n        \"top\": \"100\",\n        \"left\": \"50%-25\",\n        \"width\": \"50\",\n        \"padding\": \"10\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\n\u25a0  type:image\n\n\nFloating images\n\n\nattributes\n\n\n\n\ntype\n: \n\"image\"\n\n\nurl\n: Image url to load\n\n\naction\n: \naction\n to run on user tap event\n\n\nstyle\n\n\nwidth\n\n\nheight\n\n\ntop\n\n\nleft\n\n\nright\n\n\nbottom\n\n\ncorner_radius\n\n\ncolor\n: set the tint color (only for icons)\n\n\nresize\n: resizable when set to \n\"true\"\n (default is false)\n\n\nmove\n: can be dragged around when set to \n\"true\"\n (default is false)\n\n\nrotate\n: can be rotated when set to \n\"true\"\n (default is false)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexample\n\n\n{\n  \"layers\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"image\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.jasonclient.org/img/sticker.png\",\n      \"style\": {\n        \"width\": \"100\",\n        \"corner_radius\": \"50\",\n        \"bottom\": \"100\",\n        \"right\": \"100\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nbody.footer\n\n\nThe footer area of a view\n\n\n\n\ninput: Chat input element\n\n\ntabs: Tab element\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0  input\n\n\nChat input at the bottom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nattributes\n\n\n\u25a0 \ntextfield\n\n\n\n\nname\n: the local variable name connected to this input field.\n\n\nplaceholder\n: the placeholder text for this input field\n\n\nstyle\n\n\ncolor\n: font color\n\n\ncolor:placeholder\n: placeholder color\n\n\nbackground\n: background color for the input field\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 \nleft\n: left button (Only allows image)\n\n\n\n\nimage\n: image URL to display as the left button\n\n\naction\n: action to call when touched\n\n\nstyle\n\n\ncolor\n: tint color for the image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 \nright\n: right button (Only allows label)\n\n\n\n\ntext\n: text to display as the right button\n\n\naction\n: action to call when touched\n\n\nstyle\n\n\ncolor\n: font color\n\n\ncolor:disabled\n: disabled state font color\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 \nstyle\n\n\n\n\nbackground\n: background color for the root toolbar that contains all of the above\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexample\n\n\n{\n  \"footer\": {\n    \"input\": {\n      \"style\": {\n        \"background\": \"#cecece\"\n      },\n      \"left\": {\n        \"image\": \"https://www.jasonclient.org/img/camera.png\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"color\": \"#ff0000\"\n        },\n        \"action\": {\n          \"type\": \"$media.camera\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"textfield\": {\n        \"name\": \"message\",\n        \"placeholder\": \"Say something...\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"background\": \"#ffffff\",\n          \"color\": \"#ff0000\",\n          \"color:placeholder\": \"#ebebeb\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"right\": {\n        \"text\": \"Send\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"color\": \"#ff0000\",\n          \"color:disabled\": \"#ebebeb\"\n        },\n        \"action\": {\n          \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"url\": \"https://jasonchat.org/post.json\",\n            \"method\": \"post\",\n            \"data\": {\n              \"message\": \"{{$get.message}}\"\n            }\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$reload\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0  tabs\n\n\nBottom tab bar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nattributes\n\n\n\u2022 \nitems\n: an array of tab bar items.

            "text": "Declare commonly used style classes here so you can reuse them later.  Let's take a look at an example to demonstrate how using  head.styles  can be helpful compared to styling UI elements  inline .  For example here's an example of  inline styling :  {\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n    },\n    \"body\": {\n      \"sections\": [{\n        \"items\": [{\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 1\",\n           \"style\": {\n            \"font\": \"HelveticaNeue\",\n            \"size\": \"20\",\n            \"color\": \"#ff0000\",\n            \"padding\": \"10\"\n          } \n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 2\",\n           \"style\": {\n            \"font\": \"HelveticaNeue\",\n            \"size\": \"20\",\n            \"color\": \"#ff0000\",\n            \"padding\": \"10\"\n          } \n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 3\",\n           \"style\": {\n            \"font\": \"HelveticaNeue\",\n            \"size\": \"20\",\n            \"color\": \"#ff0000\",\n            \"padding\": \"10\"\n          } \n        }]\n      }]\n    }\n  }\n}  You can see that there's a  style  JSON for each label item. This is called  inline styling  since the style attribute is attached to the UI component directly.  Now if you look closer, you'll see that each item has exactly the same repeating style.  We can get rid of this redundancy by using  head.styles :  {\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n       \"styles\": {\n        \"styled_row\": {\n          \"font\": \"HelveticaNeue\",\n          \"size\": \"20\",\n          \"color\": \"#ff0000\",\n          \"padding\": \"10\"\n        }\n      } \n    },\n    \"body\": {\n      \"sections\": [{\n        \"items\": [{\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 1\",\n           \"class\": \"styled_row\" \n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 2\",\n           \"class\": \"styled_row\" \n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 3\",\n           \"class\": \"styled_row\" \n        }]\n      }]\n    }\n  }\n}  First look at each label item. Now the style attributes are gone, but instead we have a  class  value of  styled_row  for each.  Now let's look under  $jason.head.styles . You'll see we now have the  styled_row  defined here.

From the app menu, open  File   Open Podfile . Then find the project folder you just unzipped. From the project folder, go into  app  folder and you should see a file called  Podfile . Select that file and open it from CocoaPods app. You should see this screen:     Uncomment  pod 'GoogleMobileAds', '~  7.8'  (By removing the  #  character) and press the  install  button in the top right corner. The install will start, after that you'll see the following screen:    Notice the green Installing GoogleMobileAds line from above screenshot. That means the library has been successfully installed into the project and you can use it.   Now go to the root folder of your project and run Setup, and go through the setup process just like any other Jasonette project.  You now need to turn on the Ad feature on Xcode. To do this, open  Jasonette   Config   Constants.h  file from in your Xcode workspace (which should have opened after the setup process), Uncomment  #define ADS 1  by removing the  // .

We call it \naction\n.\n\n\nThis could be anything from accessing the device features such as camera or addressbook, to making network requests. And you can compose them to carry out any sophisticated tasks. Not to mention being able to use inline Javascript within any JSON expression.\n\n\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nActions can take the following 5 attributes\n\n\n\n\ntype\n: Specify \naction type\n. (note: THIS CANNOT BE A \nTEMPLATE EXPRESSION\n that needs to be evaluated. Use a static string.)\n\n\noptions\n: Arguments to be passed into the action (optional)\n\n\nsuccess\n: Another action to be called when the current action finishes. You can chain multiple actions to execute in sequence this way. (optional)\n\n\nerror\n: You can handle exceptions by attaching \nerror\n to an action. (optional)\n\n\n\n\nThere are two ways of calling actions: \n\n\n\n\nYou can directly attach actions to UI elements \ninline\n. In this case, the action will be executed when a user taps the element.\n\n\nYou can define an action under \nactions registry\n and trigger it by name. In this case you not only can attach actions to UI elements but also can trigger them based on system events or call them from anywhere.\n\n\n\n\nFirst read through the explanation below to learn how to define actions inline.\n\n\nAnd after that, \nlearn how to use \n\"trigger\"\n to trigger an action by name\n.\n\n\n\n\nExamples - Define Inline\n\n\nNetwork request and then render\n\n\nMake a network request and \n$render\n its content when it succeeds.\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"label\",\n  \"text\": \"refresh\",\n  \"action\": {\n    \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://jasonbase.com/things/jYJ.json\"\n    },\n    \"success\": {\n      \"type\": \"$render\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nNetwork request and then render, with error handling\n\n\nSame as above, except display a banner when the request fails.\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"label\",\n  \"text\": \"refresh\",\n  \"action\": {\n    \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://jasonbase.com/things/jYJ.json\"\n    },\n    \"success\": {\n      \"type\": \"$render\"\n    },\n    \"error\": {\n      \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"title\": \"Error\",\n        \"description\": \"Something went wrong.\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nReturn values\n\n\nYou can access an action's return value by using the variable \n$jason\n from the next action (either the \nsuccess\n or the \nerror\n action).\n\n\nFor example, \n$geo.get\n action returns the geolocation of the current device in the following format:\n\n\n{\n  \"coord\": \"51.5032510,-0.1278950\"\n}\n\n\n\nWhich means we can use this return value by accessing the \n$jason\n variable, using a \ntemplate\n like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$geo.get\",\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"title\": \"Your current coordinate\",\n      \"description\": \"{{$jason.coord}}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat kind of UI elements can have action handlers?\n\n\naction\n can be attached to various UI elements to respond to touch, but not all.\n\n\n\n\nCAN be attached to:\n\n\n\n\nmenu - \n$jason.body.header.menu\n\n\nfooter tabs - \n$jason.body.footer.tabs\n\n\nfooter input - \n$jason.body.footer.input.left\n and \n$jason.body.footer.input.right\n\n\nTop level of a section item - Example: \n$body.sections[0].items[0]\n\n\nLayer item - Example - \n$body.layers[0].items[0]\n\n\nButton component - Normally you need to attach actions at at the item level as described above. But if you want to attach an action at a component level, you can use \n\"type\": \"button\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCANNOT be attached to:\n\n\nCANNOT attach actions to a label or image component unless it's at \nitem\n level. Here's an example that DOESN'T work::\n\n\n{\n  \nitems\n: [{\n    \ntype\n: \nvertical\n,\n    \ncomponents\n: [{\n      \ntype\n: \nlabel\n,\n      \ntext\n: \ntouch me\n,\n      \naction\n: { ... } \n    }]\n  }]\n}\n\n\n\n\nlabel\n and any other \nnon-button\n type components do not respond to touch events directly.\n\n\nThis is why above code won't respond to touch, since it's attaching the action to the label.\n\n\nHowever the following code WILL respond to touch:\n\n\n{\n  \nitems\n: [{\n    \ntype\n: \nlabel\n,\n    \ntext\n: \ntouch me\n,\n    \naction\n: { ... } \n  }]\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis is because the \nlabel\n is at \nitem\n level. Jasonette automatically wraps components with a layout when they're at \nitem\n level.\n\n\nWhich means, internally above code is the same as:\n\n\n{\n  \nitems\n: [{\n    \ntype\n: \nvertical\n,\n    \naction\n: { ... },\n    \ncomponents\n: [{\n      \ntype\n: \nlabel\n,\n      \ntext\n: \ntouch me\n,\n    }]\n  }]\n}\n\n\n\n\nNotice how the action is tied to the \nvetical\n layout, which is at \nitem\n level. So this will respond to touch.\n\n\n\n\nSo what if you really want to attach an action to a component, but the component is NOT at item level?\n\n\n=\n Use \nbuttons\n, like this:\n\n\n{\n  \nitems\n: [{\n    \ntype\n: \nvertical\n,\n    \ncomponents\n: [{\n      \ntype\n: \nbutton\n,\n      \nurl\n: \nhttps://.....\n,\n      \naction\n: { ... } \n    }]\n  }]\n}\n\n\n\n\nWhere to use actions?\n\n\nActions are not just for UI components. It can be triggered in various ways, and used for various situations:\n\n\n\n\nHandling user interaction\n\n\nHandling another action's result\n\n\nHandling system events\n\n\n\n\nLet's go through each:\n\n\nA. Handling user interaction\n\n\n\u25a0 User touches an item\n\n\nAttach \naction\n attribute to \nitems\n, \nmenu\n, \nlayers\n, etc. to react to touch. (Read API documentation to see if a component supports \naction\n attribute)\n\n\nIn the example below, an \naction\n is attached to a \nmenu\n, so it gets triggered when user touches it.\n\n\n{\n  \"head\": {\n    ...\n  },\n  \"body\": {\n    \"header\": {\n      \"menu\": {\n        \"text\": \"Press me\",\n        \n\"action\": {\n          \"type\": \"$util.alert\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"title\": \"Good job!\",\n            \"description\": \"You know how to press a button!\"\n          }\n        }\n\n      }\n    },\n    ...\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\u25a0 User changes a form input value\n\n\nThere are some form input components such as \nslider\n, \nsearch\n, etc. which trigger an action whenever its value changes. Just attach \naction\n attribute to handle that event.\nIn the example below, an \naction\n is attached to a \nslider\n, so we can display a banner with the current value whenever user changes the value.\n\n\n{\n  ...\n  {\n    \"type\": \"slider\",\n    \"name\": \"gauge\",\n    \n\"action\": {\n      \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"title\": \"Current value\",\n        \"description\": \"{{$get.gauge}}\"\n      }\n    }\n\n  }\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\nB. Handling another action's result\n\n\nAll actions can have a \nsuccess\n and an \nerror\n attribute.\n\n\n\n\nsuccess\n points to an action to be triggered after the current action finishes.\n\n\nerror\n points to an action to be triggered if something goes wrong with the current action.\n\n\n\n\nBy using \nsuccess\n, we can chain multiple actions.\n\n\nIn the example below, a \n$network.request\n action gets called when a user touches the label, renders the result when it succeeds (\nsuccess\n), and displays an error message when something goes wrong (\nerror\n).\n\n\n{\n  ...\n  {\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": \"Touch me\",\n    \"action\": {\n      \n\"type\": \"$network.request\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"url\": \"https://www.jasonclient.org/items.json\"\n      },\n\n      \n\"success\": {\n        \n\"type\": \"$render\"\n\n      },\n      \"error\": {\n        \n\"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n        \"options\": {\n          \"title\": \"Error\",\n          \"description\": \"Uh oh, something went wrong.\"\n        }\n\n      }\n\n    }\n  }\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\nC. Handling system events\n\n\nSystem events\n are events automatically triggered by the system, instead of through user input.\n\n\nYou can attach any \naction\n to system events, such as \n$load\n, \n$show\n, \n$foreground\n, etc.\n\n\nHere's a brief example:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"$load\": {\n          \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"url\": \"https://jasonbase.com/things/jYJ.json\"\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$render\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"$show\": {\n          \"type\": \"$reload\"\n        },\n        \"$foreground\": {\n          \"type\": \"$reload\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    ...\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nLearn more about system events\n\n\n\n\nTriggering actions\n\n\nWhen you define an action inline, these actions have no name. Therefore you cannot reuse them form elsewhere.\n\n\nTo be able to reuse actions, you need to register them under actions registry, and then trigger them by name.\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nTo trigger an action, you can use the following syntax:\n\n\n\n\n\"trigger\"\n: Trigger an action by name, registered under the actions registry. (note: THIS CANNOT BE A \nTEMPLATE EXPRESSION\n that needs to be evaluated. You must use a static string)\n\n\n\"options\"\n (optional): \nsame as inline actions\n\n\n\"success\"\n (optional): executed when the triggered action returnes via \n$return.success\n action\n\n\n\"error\"\n (optional): executed when the triggered action returns via \n$return.error\n action\n\n\n\n\nThey look similar to inline action definition except that you use \ntrigger\n instead of \ntype\n.\n\n\n\n1. Define an action under the actions registry\n\n\nFirst, you need to define the action inside \nhead.actions\n. In this case we name it \nrefresh_view\n:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"refresh_view\": {\n          \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"url\": \"https://jasonbase.com/things/jYJ.json\"\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$render\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\n2. Trigger it by name\n\n\nSecond, to actually trigger it by name, just attach an action with a \ntrigger\n attribute, like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"label\",\n  \"text\": \"Refresh\",\n  \"action\": {\n    \"trigger\": \"refresh_view\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nCool thing about this is, now you can trigger this action from anywhere in your code. You can trigger it manually from another action, or you could make it so that a system event automatically triggers the action.\n\n\nHere's an example where \nrefresh_view\n is triggered whenever the view comes into focus (\n$show\n) or comes back from background (\n$foreground\n):\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"$show\": {\n          \"trigger\": \"refresh_view\"\n        },\n        \"$foreground\": {\n          \"trigger\": \"refresh_view\"\n        },\n        \"refresh_view\": {\n          \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"url\": \"https://jasonbase.com/things/jYJ.json\"\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$render\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\nHere's an example where an action triggers another action (\nrefresh\n sets the cache, and then triggers \nfetch\n):\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"refresh\": {\n          \"type\": \"$cache.set\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"items\": []\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"trigger\": \"fetch\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"fetch\": {\n          \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"url\": \"https://jasonbase.com/things/jYJ.json\"\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$render\"\n          }\n      },\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Return from subroutine when finished\n\n\nWe saw from above that actions can trigger other actions.\n\n\nBut so far these action call chain examples have been one-way trip only, which means once an action triggers another action its life is over.\n\n\nYou can't do things like making a call and waiting for it to return with its result, and then continue on where it left off, using that value.\n\n\nLet's look at the \nrefresh\n example from above:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"refresh\": {\n          \"type\": \"$cache.set\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"items\": []\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"trigger\": \"fetch\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"fetch\": {\n          \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"url\": \"https://jasonbase.com/things/jYJ.json\"\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$render\"\n          }\n        }\n        ...\n      }\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\nThe problem with this is each action does more than one thing:\n\n\n\n\nrefresh\n resets the cache AND triggers fetch\n\n\nfetch\n makes a network request AND renders the result.\n\n\n\n\nMaybe we want to add another action that resets the cache before doing something. Then, we need to add the same \n$cache.set\n action again.\n\n\nMaybe we want to make the network request but do something else with the result instead of rendering.\n\n\nIt becomes difficult to reuse these actions since one action does more than one thing.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we can break these actions out into self-contained modules so that:\n\n\n\n\nOne action only does one thing.\n\n\nEach action ends by \nreturning its result instead of triggering another action\n using \n$return.success\n or \n$return.error\n actions.\n\n\n\n\nHere's the solution:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"reset\": {\n          \"type\": \"$cache.set\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"items\": []\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$return.success\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"refresh\": {\n          \"trigger\": \"reset\",\n          \"success\": {\n            \"trigger\": \"fetch\",\n            \"success\": {\n              \"type\": \"$render\"\n            }\n          }\n        },\n        \"fetch\": {\n          \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"url\": \"https://jasonbase.com/things/jYJ.json\"\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$return.success\"\n          }\n        }\n        ...\n      }\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\nHere, the \nreset\n action only resets the cache.\n\n\nAnd \nfetch\n action only makes a network request and returns its result. (No $render)\n\n\nLastly the \nrefresh\n action functions as the main program that triggers each action one after another (triggers \nreset\n, then triggers \nfetch\n, and finally executes \n$render\n)\n\n\nWhen to use trigger vs. defining actions inline\n\n\nIn \nmost cases\n it's recommended that you define your actions under \nactions registry\n and trigger them using \n\"trigger\"\n.\n\n\nFor example, instead of:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n    },\n    \"body\": {\n      \"sections\": [{\n        \"items\": [{\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"item 1\",\n          \"action\": {\n            \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n            \"options\": {\n              \"title\": \"Banner\",\n              \"description\": \"Pressed item\"\n            }\n          }\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"item 2\",\n          \"action\": {\n            \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n            \"options\": {\n              \"title\": \"Banner\",\n              \"description\": \"Pressed item\"\n            }\n          }\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"item 3\",\n          \"action\": {\n            \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n            \"options\": {\n              \"title\": \"Banner\",\n              \"description\": \"Pressed item\"\n            }\n          }\n        }]\n      }]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nYou may want to define the action inside \nhead.actions\n, like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"show_banner\": {\n          \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"title\": \"Banner\",\n            \"description\": \"Pressed item\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"body\": {\n      \"sections\": [{\n        \"items\": [{\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"item 1\",\n          \"action\": {\n            \"trigger\": \"show_banner\"\n          }\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"item 2\",\n          \"action\": {\n            \"trigger\": \"show_banner\"\n          }\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"item 3\",\n          \"action\": {\n            \"trigger\": \"show_banner\"\n          }\n        }]\n      }]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nBenefit 1\n\n\nAs you can see above, using \ntrigger\n lets you define a single action once and reuse it from multiple places in your view. It removes redundant code.\n\n\n\n\nBenefit 2\n\n\nWhen you define an action inline, its behavior is fixed. For example, the \nshow_banner\n action example above only does one thing: It displays a banner that says \"Pressed item\".\n\n\nHowever in many cases we want to write one action and reuse them for various purposes. Maybe we want to display a banner that says \"Pressed item 1\", or \"Pressed item 2\".\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"show_banner\": {\n          \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"title\": \"Banner\",\n            \"description\": \"Pressed item {{$jason.item}}\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"body\": {\n      \"sections\": [{\n        \"items\": [{\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"item 1\",\n          \"action\": {\n            \"trigger\": \"show_banner\",\n            \"options\": {\n              \"item\": \"1\"\n            }\n          }\n        }]\n      }]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeclaring actions\n\n\nThere are two ways you can call actions:\n\n\n1. Inline action\n\n\nAttach \naction\n attributes directly to UI elements\n\n\n2. Action registry\n\n\nDefine actions inside \n$jason.head.actions\n and call them by name\n\n\n\n\nInline Action\n\n\nInline actions are basically what we've been talking about so far. You directly attach an \naction\n to events, UI components, and another action. Here's an example:\n\n\n{\n  ...\n  \"type\": \"label\",\n  \"action\": {\n    \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"title\": \"Hello\",\n      \"description\": \"World\"\n    }\n  }\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Registry\n\n\nWe can define an action once and refer to them whenever we need to, instead of writing one for every situation.\n\n\n\u25a0   Comparison with inline actions\n\n\nFor example, here's an \ninline action\n example. We display multiple \nitems\n, and each item has the same \naction\n attribute content.\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n    },\n    \"body\": {\n      \"sections\": [{\n        \"items\": [{\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 1\",\n          \n\"action\": {\n            \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n            \"options\": {\n              \"url\": \"https://jasonclient.org/submit\",\n              \"method\": \"POST\"\n            },\n            \"success\": {\n              \"type\": \"$render\"\n            }\n          }\n\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 2\",\n          \n\"action\": {\n            \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n            \"options\": {\n              \"url\": \"https://jasonclient.org/submit\",\n              \"method\": \"POST\"\n            },\n            \"success\": {\n              \"type\": \"$render\"\n            }\n          }\n\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 3\",\n          \n\"action\": {\n            \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n            \"options\": {\n              \"url\": \"https://jasonclient.org/submit\",\n              \"method\": \"POST\"\n            },\n            \"success\": {\n              \"type\": \"$render\"\n            }\n          }\n\n        }]\n      }]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nBelow we have the same example, but using \n$jason.head.actions\n instead of re-defining the same action every time inline:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n      \"actions\": {\n        \n\"submit_item\": {\n          \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"url\": \"https://jasonclient.org/submit\",\n            \"method\": \"POST\"\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$render\"\n          }\n        }\n\n      }\n    },\n    \"body\": {\n      \"sections\": [{\n        \"items\": [{\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 1\",\n          \n\"action\": {\n            \"trigger\": \"submit_item\"\n          }\n\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 2\",\n          \n\"action\": {\n            \"trigger\": \"submit_item\"\n          }\n\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 3\",\n          \n\"action\": {\n            \"trigger\": \"submit_item\"\n          }\n\n        }]\n      }]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nHere's what's going on:\n\n\n\n\nDeclare an action under \n$jason.head.actions\n (in this case we've named it \nsubmit_item\n).\n\n\nThen we \ntrigger\n the action from anywhere using the name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0   System events\n\n\nSome actions are automatically triggered by the system when a certain event occurs. When you wish to take advantage of these, simply add them to \nactions\n. They are:\n\n\n\n\n1. $load\n\n\n$load\n gets called once automatically when the view loads for the first time.\n\n\nHere's an example where we make a network request when the view loads, and then render the response using the template.\n\n\n{\n  ...\n  \"$load\": {\n    \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n    \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"http://jasonclient.org/req.json\"\n    },\n    \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$render\"\n    }\n  }\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n2. $show\n\n\n$show\n gets called automatically whenever the view appears. For example when coming back from a modal view, coming back from its next view via back button, etc.\n\n\nHere's an example\n\n\n{\n  ...\n  \"$show\": {\n    \"type\": \"$reload\"\n  },\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n3. $foreground\n\n\n$foreground\n is called automatically whenever the app comes back from the background state.\n\n\n{\n  ...\n  \"$foreground\": {\n    \"type\": \"$reload\"\n  },\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n4. $pull\n\n\n$pull\n gets called whenever user makes a pull to refresh action\n\n\n{\n  ...\n  \"$pull\": {\n    \"type\": \"$reload\"\n  },\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI\n\n\n\u2500\u2500 REQUIRE \u2500\u2500\n\n\n$require\n\n\nThe \n$require\n action imports remote JSON files in parallel.\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$require\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"profiles\": [\"https://...\", \"https://...\", \"https://\"],\n    \"items\": [\"https://...\", \"https://...\", \"https://...\"]\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$render\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nIt works similar to \n$network.request\n but with a few differences:\n\n\n\n\nIt can fetch multiple remote JSON files in parallel.\n\n\nIt is only for making simple \nGET\n requests. No POST/PUT/DELETE requests, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\nThe \noptions\n object defines what the return value should look like. For example, the following \n$require\n action would fetch the contents of \nhttps://hello.world/1.json\n and then attach it to the \nprofile\n attribute.\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$require\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"profile\": \"https://hello.world/1.json\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nWhen you chain this action with another action, you should be able to access the contents of \nhttps://hello.world/1.json\n via \n{{$jason.profile}}\n.\n\n\nThe value in the key/value pair can take the form of:\n\n\n\n\n\n\na single url: \n\"profile\": \"https://...\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nan array of urls: \n\"profiles\": [\"https://...\", \"https://...\", \"https://...\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 return value\n\n\nreturns the constructed \noptions\n object.\n\n\nFor example, let's say \nhttps://blahblah.blah/1.json\n and \nhttps://blahblah.blah/2.json\n each contained the following JSON files respectively:\n\n\n{\n  \"items\": [\"abc\", \"def\", \"ghi\"]\n}\n\n{\n  \"items\": [\"cba\", \"fed\", \"ihg\"]\n}\n\n\n\nWe can fetch them in parallel like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$require\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"items1\": \"https://blahblah.blah/1.json\",\n    \"items2\": \"https://blahblah.blah/2.json\"\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$render\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nAs a result, when we are ready to \n$render\n, the \n$jason\n value will be:\n\n\n{\n  \"items1\": {\n    \"items\": [\"abc\", \"def\", \"ghi\"]\n  },\n  \"items2\": {\n    \"items\": [\"cba\", \"fed\", \"ihg\"]\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\u25a0 note\n\n\nUnlike \n$set\n or \n$cache.set\n, the \n$require\n action on its own doesn't persist the data in any way.\n\n\nSo if you want to persist them to a local variable or a cache variable, you will need to chain the result to these actions and take care of assignment that way. Here's an example:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$require\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"profiles\": [\"https://...\", \"https://...\", \"https://\"]\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$set\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"profiles\": \"{{$jason.profiles}}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2500\u2500 FUNCTIONAL \u2500\u2500\n\n\nJust like functions in any other programming language, you can call an action from an action, wait for it to return, and use the return value to continue where it left off.\n\n\n\n\n$lambda\n\n\nCall another action by name (This is how \ntrigger\n is implemented internally)\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$lambda\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"name\": \"refresh\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://jasonbase.com/things/3nf.json\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$render\"\n  },\n  \"error\": {\n    \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"title\": \"Error\",\n      \"description\": \"Something went wrong\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nAbove code is the same as:\n\n\n{\n  \"trigger\": \"refresh\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"https://jasonbase.com/things/3nf.json\"\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$render\"\n  },\n  \"error\": {\n    \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"title\": \"Error\",\n      \"description\": \"Something went wrong\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nIn most cases you may want to use \ntrigger\n but sometimes it's useful to use \n$lambda\n directly, for example if you want to dynamically trigger different actions. Example:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$lambda\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"name\": \"{{action_name}}\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://jasonbase.com/things/3nf.json\"\n    }\n  },\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\n\n\nname: the name of the action to trigger, registered \nunder actions registry\n\n\noptions: \noptions object\n to pass to the next action\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 return value\n\n\n\n\nWhatever the triggered action returns via \n$return.success\n or \n$return.error\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$return.success\n\n\nUnless you explicitly call \n$return.success\n or \n$return.error\n, all triggered actions terminate when they reach the end of the call chain.\n\n\nTo return to the action which called the current action with a \nsuccess\n state, we need to use \n$return.success\n.\n\n\nThen the caller action will resume where it left off and keep executing its \nsuccess\n action.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\n\n\nThe return value to pass back to the caller action.  If not specified, it automatically returns the current \n$jason\n value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 no \nsuccess\n or \nerror\n of its own\n\n\n\n\nnone\n : Since \n$return.success\n is an action solely designed for returning the control back to the caller action, \n$return.success\n itself does not have \nsuccess\n or \nerror\n actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 example\n\n\nIn the example below, the \ndisplay_banner\n triggers \nfetch\n, and then displays a banner using the return value \n$jason\n.\n\n\nNotice how the \n$lambda\n action's \nsuccess\n takes over after the \nfetch\n action returns via \n$return.success\n.\n\n\n{\n  \"display_banner\": {\n    \"type\": \"$lambda\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"name\": \"fetch\"\n    },\n    \"success\": {\n      \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"title\": \"The number of items:\",\n        \"description\": \"{{$jason.items.length}}\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"fetch\": {\n    \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://jasonbase.com/things/3nf.json\"\n    },\n    \"success\": {\n      \"type\": \"$return.success\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"items\": \"{{$jason}}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nAgain, this is the same as using \ntrigger\n:\n\n\n{\n  \"display_banner\": {\n    \"trigger\": \"return_homer_simpson\",\n    \"success\": {\n      \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"title\": \"The number of items:\",\n        \"description\": \"{{$jason.items.length}}\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"fetch\": {\n    \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://jasonbase.com/things/3nf.json\"\n    },\n    \"success\": {\n      \"type\": \"$return.success\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"items\": \"{{$jason}}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$return.error\n\n\nPretty much the same as \n$return.success\n, except that it returns the control back to the caller action's \nerror\n action.\n\n\n\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 VIEW \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\nActions related to drawing views\n\n\n\n\n$reload\n\n\nRefreshes the view completely by re-fetching content from the current URL.\n\n\n{\n  \"items\": [{\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": \"Refresh\",\n    \"action\": {\n      \"type\": \"$reload\"\n    }\n  }]\n}\n\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 return value\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\nThis will reload the page when a user taps on the \nitem\n.\n\n\n\n\n$render\n\n\nRenders a \ntemplate\n with data\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\n\n\ndata\n: Data to render.

See \nhtml templating\n to learn more about how to render an HTML string natively using Jason)\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 return value\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 example\n\n\nRendering return value from the previous action\n\n\nBy default \n$render\n renders the data returned from its previous action. \n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"https://jasonbase.com/things/gbe.json\"\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$render\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nFor example, let's say the network request returns the following result:\n\n\n{\n    \"name\": \"Mr. Fisherman\",\n    \"image\": \"http://i.giphy.com/OmK8lulOMQ9XO.gif\",\n    \"status\": \"Busy fishing on the iPhone\"\n}\n\n\n\nAll Jasonette actions store their return values under \n$jason\n object when they return.\n\n\nSo we can access above value using the \n$jason\n variable.\n\n\n\n\nHere's how we would write the \nbody\n template:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          \"sections\": [{\n            \"items\": [{\n              \"type\": \"image\",\n              \"url\": \"{{$jason.image}}\"\n            }, {\n              \"type\": \"label\",\n              \"text\": \"{{$jason.text}}\"\n            }, {\n              \"type\": \"label\",\n              \"text\": \"{{$jason.status}}\"\n            }]\n          }]\n        }\n      ...\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nSpecifying data when rendering\n\n\nIn most cases you will use the above method--rendering data passed in as a return value from the previous action. \n\n\nHowever, you can also use \n$render\n as standalone, by manually specifying its data, like this (You rarely need to use this method):\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$render\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"data\": [{\n      \"name\": \"Ethan\",\n      \"id\": \"1\"\n    }, {\n      \"name\": \"Jason\",\n      \"id\": \"2\"\n    }, {\n      \"name\": \"Jasonette\",\n      \"id\": \"3\"\n    }]\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nRendering the body template\n\n\nIn most cases you will use \n$render\n without manually specifying the template, because it will assume you're rendering the \nbody\n template. For example, a typical \n$render\n looks like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"https://jasonclient.com/req.json\"\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$render\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nIf no \ntemplate\n option is specified, \n$render\n will look for a \nbody\n template inside \n$jason.head.templates\n and use that to render the data. For example, from the following JSON,\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          \"sections\": [{\n            \"items\": {\n              \"{{#each $jason}}\": {\n                \"type\": \"label\",\n                \"text\": \"{{text}}\"\n              }\n            }\n          }]\n        }\n      ...\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nWhen \n$render\n runs, it will take the JSON markup inside \n$jason.head.templates.body\n, render it using the data, onto the view.\n\n\nManually specifying the template to render\n\n\nBut sometimes you can also specify the template name. For example, we may want to render a template named \nempty\n instead of the default \nbody\n template:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          ....\n        },\n        \"empty_template\": {\n          \"sections\": [{\n            \"items\": [{\n              \"type\": \"label\",\n              \"text\": \"Empty view\"\n            }]\n          }]\n        }\n      ...\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nIn this case we could pass \n{\"template\": \"empty_template\"}\n as an option, like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"https://jasonclient.com/req.json\"\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$render\"\n  },\n  \"error\": {\n    \"type\": \"$render\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"template\": \"empty_template\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nHow is \n$render\n different from \n$reload\n?\n\n\n$render\n redraws an existing template you already downloaded, using dynamic data. \n$reload\n completely refreshes the current URL. Here's an example scenario:\n\n\n\n\nJason view loads and fetches a JSON markup from the server (\nmain.json\n)\n\n\nmain.json\n makes an API request to Twitter to fetch Tweets. (https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/user_timeline.json)\n\n\nThen it renders the result using its \nbody\n template, which is under \n$jason.head.templates.body\n in \nmain.json\n.\n\n\nFrom this point on, calling \n$render\n simply takes the \n$jason.head.templates.body\n we have in memory, and renders whatever data we pass in.\n\n\nHowever calling \n$reload\n will make a full refresh, going back to step 1.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\nIn most cases, you call \n$render\n at the end of an action call chain, rendering the \n$jason\n return value from its preceding action.\n\n\nAlso, in most cases \n$render\n is used without specifying \ntemplate\n or \ndata\n options.\n\n\nJust don't forget to have a template under \n$jason.head.templates.body\n, since \n$render\n will automatically render that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, remember that you can access the return value using \n$jason\n from the template.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$snapshot\n\n\nTakes a snapshot of the currently visible screen\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 return value\n\n\nThe return value is in this format:\n\n\n{\n  \"data\": \"....\",\n  \"data_uri\": \"....\",\n  \"content_type\": \"image/jpeg\",\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nReturns the snapshot as raw data under \ndata\n attribute.\n\n\nAlso returns \ndata_uri\n attribute, which contains the \ndata-uri\n\n\nYou can utilize the \ndata\n by passing it to another action using \nsuccess\n\n\nThe \ncontent_type\n is \n\"image/jpeg\"\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 example\n\n\nTake a snapshot and share\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$snapshot\",\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$util.share\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"items\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"image\",\n          \"data\": \"{{$jason.data}}\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare sheet\n\n\nSMS example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$href\n\n\n\n\nAn action version of \nhref\n. Works the same way, but just another way to invoke href.\n\n\nUse this when a component doesn't support \nhref\n attribute directly but supports an \naction\n.\n\n\nSometimes it's useful when you want to invoke \nhref\n without displaying a disclosure indicator. (href comes with a disclosure indicator by default)\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\nIt's the same set of attributes as \nhref\n since it simply invokes the href when triggered.\n\n\n\n\nurl\n\n\nthe url to transition to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nview\n\n\ncan be \n\"web\"\n | \n\"app\"\n | \n\"jason\"\n (default)\n\n\n\n\n\n\noptions\n\n\nWorks the same way as the \noptions object for href\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\ntransition\n\n\ncan be \n\"modal\"\n | \n\"fullscreen\"\n | \n\"push\"\n (default)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0  return value\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 example\n\n\n{\n   \"type\": \"label\",\n   \"text\": \"trigger href\",\n   \"action\": {\n     \"type\": \"$href\",\n     \"options\": {\n       \"url\": \"...\",\n       \"transition\": \"...\",\n       \"view\": \"...\"\n     }\n   }\n}\n\n\n\nis same as:\n\n\n{\n   \"type\": \"label\",\n   \"text\": \"trigger href\",\n   \"href\": {\n     \"url\": \"...\",\n     \"transition\": \"...\",\n     \"view\": \"...\"\n   }\n}\n\n\n\nThe only difference is: in case of \nitems\n the second option displays a disclosure indicator since we're directly using \nhref\n\n\n\n\n$close\n\n\nClose a modal (works when the currently view is a modal)\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 return value\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$back\n\n\nTransition one step back from the current view\n\n\n\n\nIf the current view is a modal, it closes the current view\n\n\nOtherwise it slides back to the previous view\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 return value\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2500\u2500 NETWORK \u2500\u2500\n\n\n\n\n$network.request\n\n\nMake GET/POST/PUT/DELETE network requests\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\n\n\nurl\n: The url to access.\n\n\nmethod\n: \n\"get\"\n | \n\"post\"\n | \n\"put\"\n | \n\"delete\"\n.\n\n\ndata\n: Parameters to send along with the url (optional)\n\n\nheader\n: Headers to attach to every request if any (optional)\n\n\ndata_type\n: Specifies how the fetched response will be processed. Can be \njson\n, \nhtml\n, \nrss\n, or \nraw\n. \njson\n assumes that the return value will be in JSON format, whereas \nraw\n expects a plain text. You can use \nraw\n type when fetching a plain text or CSV. \nhtml\n is for fetching HTML content and especially required when you need to utilize HTML requests associated with cookies/sessions. \nrss\n is used to fetch RSS. The default is \njson\n.\n\n\ncontent_type\n: Specifies which format the parameters will be sent as.

Simple JSON GET request\n\n\nHere's a simple example of GET request, fetching JSON. We don't need to specify \n{\"type\": \"get\"}\n here since the default type is \n\"get\"\n\n\n{\n    \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n    \"options\": {\n        \"url\": \"http://plasticfm.herokuapp.com/things/3.json\"\n    },\n    \"success\": {\n        \"type\": \"$render\"\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2. More complex JSON requests\n\n\nThis time we're going to make a POST request, with all the data and header\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"http://www.jasonbase.com/messages.json\",\n    \"method\": \"post\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"user_id\": \"fI9\",\n      \"message\": \"Hello there\"\n    },\n    \"header\": {\n      \"auth_token\": \"fnekfla98dls9sNFK0nf3\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$render\"\n  },\n  \"error\": {\n    \"type\": \"$util.alert\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"title\": \"Error\",\n      \"description\": \"Uh oh, something went wrong\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3. HTML GET request\n\n\nYou can also make HTML type requests. Here's a request with \nhtml\n data_type.\n\n\n{\n    \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n    \"options\": {\n        \"url\": \"https://news.ycombinator.com/newest\",\n        \"dataType\": \"html\"\n    },\n    \"success\": {\n        \"type\": \"$render\",\n        \"options\": {\n            \"type\": \"html\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nIt fetches the url as \nhtml\n type, and then renders it using the \nhtml\n type parser. See templates for more details on how to render HTML content in Jasonette.\n\n\n\n\nExample 4. HTML POST request with cookies\n\n\nDealing with cookies is simple. All you need to do is make the request to create a session. Jason will automatically store the returned cookie, and then attach it to all subsequent requests.\nHere's an example of signing into a website by making an HTML data_type \n$network.request\n call:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"https://news.ycombinator.com/login\",\n    \"method\": \"post\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"acct\": \"{{$get.username}}\",\n      \"pw\": \"{{$get.password}}\"\n    },\n    \"data_type\": \"html\"\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://news.ycombinator.com/saved?id={{$get.username}}\",\n      \"data_type\": \"html\"\n    },\n    \"success\": {\n      \"type\": \"$render\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"type\": \"html\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nIt first signs into the site by making a \nPOST\n request of \n{\"data_type\": \"html\"}\n. Then it stores the cookie returned from the server.\n\n\nOnce the login succeeds, it makes a \nGET\n request of \n{\"data_type\": \"html\"}\n to an actual content API. The cookie from the previous step is automatically applied to the request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$network.upload\n\n\nUpload data to cloud providers. Currently supports S3, but \nfeel free to extend\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\n\n\ntype\n: \n\"s3\"\n (Currently only supports s3)\n\n\nbucket\n: s3 bucket name\n\n\npath\n: the s3 path to upload the file\n\n\nsign_url\n: To upload files to s3, you need to acquire a signed url from S3 first, and then upload it to that URL.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 return value\n\n\n\n\nfile_name\n: a randomly generated filename. When \n$network.upload\n is called, it automatically generates a random, hashed filename to ensure uniqueness, and then stores the file onto the cloud provider with that name.\n\n\nWe need this attribute to keep track of the data we've just uploaded. For example, we may want to store the filename somewhere so we can access this file later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 example\n\n\nThis example takes a photo and uploads to S3.\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$media.camera\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"quality\": \"0.4\"\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$network.upload\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"type\": \"s3\",\n      \"bucket\": \"fm.ethan.jason\",\n      \"data\": \"{{$jason.data}}\",\n      \"path\": \"\",\n      \"sign_url\": \"https://imagejason.herokuapp.com/sign_url\"\n    },\n    \"success\": {\n      \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"url\": \"https://imagejason.herokuapp.com/post\",\n        \"method\": \"post\",\n        \"data\": {\n          \"bucket\": \"fm.ethan.jason\",\n          \"path\": \"/\",\n          \"filename\": \"{{$jason.filename}}\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"success\": {\n        \"type\": \"$reload\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nHere's what's going on above:\n\n\n1. The client takes a photo using the \n$media.camera\n action and passes the raw data to \n$network.upload\n as \n$jason\n.\n\n\n2. The \n$network.upload\n first looks at \noptions.sign_url\n and makes a request to get the signed url.\n\n\n3. The server should return a signed url for S3.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nsign_url\n attribute is the URL to your server, and your server should generate a signed url and return the result in the following format:\n\n\n{ \"$jason\": \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/...../...?AWSAccessKeyId=.....\nExpires=.....\nSignature=.....\"}\n\n\nSee the full server side code\n to learn how to generate signed urls.\n\n\n\n\n4. The client then uploads the content passed in as \ndata\n to the just generated signed url, using a randomly generated filename.\n\n\n5. Once the upload finishes, the \n$network.upload\n returns the filename generated from step 3.\n\n\n6. Then it stores the filename to our server by making a POST \n$network.request\n to \nhttps://imagejason.herokuapp.com/post\n\n\n\nCheck out the full code on Github:\n\n\ns3-upload-example\n\n\n\n\n\u2500\u2500 SESSION \u2500\u2500\n\n\n\n\nCheck out a functional demo app with backend server, with user accounts\n\n\nsession-example\n\n\n\n\n$session.set\n\n\n\n\n$session.set\n takes care of \ntoken authentication\n to authenticate into any mobile API.\n\n\nYou need to call \n$session.set\n \nafter\n a \n$network.request\n action to an authentication endpoint, which returns an authentication token.\n\n\nSessions are tied to domain, which means as long as you authenticate with a domain, all other URLs under the same domain will use the same token therefore you won't need to re-authenticate for every URL under the same domain.\n\n\nFor cookie based HTML authentication, see \nExample 4 from \n$network.request\n above\n.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 options\n\n\n\n\ndomain\n: the domain to set the session for (example: \"jasonbase.com\")\n\n\nheader\n: headers to attach to every future \n$network.request\n to the specified domain.\n\n\nbody\n: body parameters to attach to every future \n$network.request\n to the specified domain.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 return value\n\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 example\n\n\nHere's an example:\n\n\n\"action\": {\n  \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"https://sessionjason.herokuapp.com/users/sign_in.json\",\n    \"method\": \"post\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"user[email]\": \"{{$get.email}}\",\n      \"user[password]\": \"{{$get.password}}\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$session.set\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"domain\": \"sessionjason.herokuapp.com\",\n      \"header\": {\n        \"X-User-Email\": \"{{$jason.email}}\",\n        \"X-User-Token\": \"{{$jason.authentication_token}}\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"success\": {\n      \"type\": \"$href\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"url\": \"https://sessionjason.herokuapp.com/posts.json\",\n        \"transition\": \"replace\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"error\": {\n    \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"title\": \"Enter credentials\",\n      \"description\": \"Please enter both email and password\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nLet's walk through each step.\n\n\nThe first action is \n$network.request\n. It makes a POST request to \nhttps://sessionjason.herokuapp.com/users/sign_in.json\n, to which the server returns the following JSON as a response:\n\n\n{\n  \"id\":2,\n  \"email\":\"ethan@ethan.fm\",\n  \"created_at\":\"2016-10-14T22:55:00.664Z\",\n  \"updated_at\":\"2016-10-15T05:22:41.730Z\",\n  \"authentication_token\":\"fnekz4hf7ghw95m6ks0rf01j\"\n}\n\n\n\nNext, we proceed to the next action, which is \n$session.set\n. Here we use the return value from the \n$network.request\n and set the header.\n\n\n\n\nThis stores the \nheader\n object for the specified \ndomain\n (session.herokuapp.com), and this stored header will be attached to all future \n$network.request\n to this domain. The header to be stored will look like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"header\": {\n    \"X-User-Email\": \"ethan@ethan.fm\",\n    \"X-User-Token\": \"fnekz4hf7ghw95m6ks0rf01j\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the \n$session.set\n, it goes to the next action \n$href\n. This transitions to \nhttps://sessionjason.herokuapp.com/posts.json\n.\n\n\n\n\nThis time, the network request will automatically attach the stored header to the request.\n\n\n\n\nThe server will recognize the authentication token and respond with the actual \nposts.json\n.\n\n\n\n\n$session.reset\n\n\nThis action lets you clear sessions for a specified domain. Can be used for both \ntoken authentication\n and \nweb authentication via cookies\n\n\n\n\nFor token authentication, it clears your headers and body parameters objects tied to the domain, created through \n$session.set\n.\n\n\nFor web requests (html), it clears your cookie tied to the domain, created through \nhtml\n type \n$network.request\n, \nas described here\n.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0  options\n\n\n\n\nurl\n: The url from which to sign out.\n\n\ndomain\n: The domain from which to sign out (used for APIs)\n\n\ndata\n: Parameters to send along with the url (optional)\n\n\ntype\n: \n\"html\"\n | \n\"json\"\n (Default is \"json\")\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 examples\n\n\nExample 1.

We are setting local variables \nfirstname\n and \nlastname\n to \nethan\n and \ngliechtenstein\n respectively.\n\n\ndo something after setting the local variable\n\n\nIf you're using a local variable in your body template and wish to update the view to reflect the updated local variable, you need to call \n$render\n. \n\n\nFor example you can add a \nsuccess\n attribute to above action to redraw the view after update, like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"label\",\n  \"text\": \"{{$get.firstname}} {{$get.lastname}}\",\n  \"action\": {\n    \"type\": \"$set\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"firstname\": \"ethan\",\n      \"lastname\": \"gliechtenstein\"\n    },\n    \"success\": {\n      \"type\": \"$render\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n$get\n\n\nYou can access local variables by using a template expression \n{{$get.VARIABLE_NAME}}\n\n\n\n\nNormally, the usage flow is:\n\n\nSet a variable using \n$set\n action\n\n\nUse the variable from template through \n{{$get.VARIABLE_NAME}}\n expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 example\n\n\nOnce you set \nfirstname\n and \nlastname\n like we did above, we can use them like this:\n\n\n[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": \"{{$get.firstname}}\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": \"{{$get.lastname}}\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n\nHere's a full usage example using both \n$set\n action and \n$get\n expression.\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"$load\": {\n          \"type\": \"$set\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"bar\": \"#\"\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$render\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"$pull\": {\n          \"type\": \"$set\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"bar\": \"{{$get.bar+'#'}}\"\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$render\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          \"sections\": [{\n            \"items\": [{\n              \"type\": \"label\",\n              \"text\": \"{{$get.bar}}\"\n            }]\n          }]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nHere's what's going on:\n\n\n\n\nWhen the view loads (\n$load\n system event), it sets the local variable \nbar\n's value as \"#\", then renders the template with a label that displays the variable \nbar\n (\n{{$get.bar}}\n).\n\n\nWhen the user makes a pull to refresh gesture (\n$pull\n event), it appends another \"#\" to \nbar\n and then renders again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2500\u2500 CACHE \u2500\u2500\n\n\nCache lets you persist and retrieve content. Unlike local variables, it will stay even when you close the app and come back.\n\n\n\n\nCache vs. Local variable\n\n\n\n\nCache and local variables are both sandboxed per view url. Therefore anything you store to cache and local variable is stored just for that view.\n\n\nLocal variables are only on memory so will go away when the view refreshes. But cache is stored persistently and stays until you overwrite or reset it, even if the app is killed and restarted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite\n\n\n$cache.set\n action is used to store to cache.\n\n\n\u25a0  options\n\n\n\n\nkey:value pairs. The key is the cache variable name, and the value is the variable's value.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 return value\n\n\nreturns the updated \n$cache\n object, which looks like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"items\": [...]\n}\n\n\n\n\u25a0 examples\n\n\nExample 1. Set cache\n\n\nIn the following example, it first makes a \n$network.request\n, and then takes its return value \n{{$jason}}\n and stores it to cache using the \n$cache.set\n action.\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"http://jasonclient.org/api/items.json\"\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$cache.set\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"items\": \"{{$jason}}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nExample 2.

Just like \n$cache\n, it will stay even when you close the app and come back later.\n\n\n\n\nGlobal vs. Cache vs. Local Variables\n\n\n\n\nCache is sandboxed per URL, but Global variables are global to the entire app.\n\n\nBoth Global and Cache persist data so they will stick around unless you delete the app or explicitly delete them using \n$cache.reset\n or \n$global.reset\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite\n\n\n$global.set\n action is used to write to global variables.\n\n\n\u25a0  options\n\n\n\n\nkey:value pairs.

Here's an example that DOESN'T work::  {\n   items : [{\n     type :  vertical ,\n     components : [{\n       type :  label ,\n       text :  touch me ,\n       action : { ... } \n    }]\n  }]\n}  label  and any other  non-button  type components do not respond to touch events directly.  This is why above code won't respond to touch, since it's attaching the action to the label.  However the following code WILL respond to touch:  {\n   items : [{\n     type :  label ,\n     text :  touch me ,\n     action : { ... } \n  }]\n}  This is because the  label  is at  item  level. Jasonette automatically wraps components with a layout when they're at  item  level.  Which means, internally above code is the same as:  {\n   items : [{\n     type :  vertical ,\n     action : { ... },\n     components : [{\n       type :  label ,\n       text :  touch me ,\n    }]\n  }]\n}  Notice how the action is tied to the  vetical  layout, which is at  item  level. So this will respond to touch.   So what if you really want to attach an action to a component, but the component is NOT at item level?  =  Use  buttons , like this:  {\n   items : [{\n     type :  vertical ,\n     components : [{\n       type :  button ,\n       url :  https://..... ,\n       action : { ... } \n    }]\n  }]\n}",

            "location": "/actions/#3-return-from-subroutine-when-finished", 
            "text": "We saw from above that actions can trigger other actions.  But so far these action call chain examples have been one-way trip only, which means once an action triggers another action its life is over.  You can't do things like making a call and waiting for it to return with its result, and then continue on where it left off, using that value.  Let's look at the  refresh  example from above:  {\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"refresh\": {\n          \"type\": \"$cache.set\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"items\": []\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"trigger\": \"fetch\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"fetch\": {\n          \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"url\": \"https://jasonbase.com/things/jYJ.json\"\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$render\"\n          }\n        }\n        ...\n      }\n  ...\n}  The problem with this is each action does more than one thing:   refresh  resets the cache AND triggers fetch  fetch  makes a network request AND renders the result.   Maybe we want to add another action that resets the cache before doing something. Then, we need to add the same  $cache.set  action again.  Maybe we want to make the network request but do something else with the result instead of rendering.  It becomes difficult to reuse these actions since one action does more than one thing.  To solve this problem, we can break these actions out into self-contained modules so that:   One action only does one thing.  Each action ends by  returning its result instead of triggering another action  using  $return.success  or  $return.error  actions.   Here's the solution:  {\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"reset\": {\n          \"type\": \"$cache.set\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"items\": []\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$return.success\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"refresh\": {\n          \"trigger\": \"reset\",\n          \"success\": {\n            \"trigger\": \"fetch\",\n            \"success\": {\n              \"type\": \"$render\"\n            }\n          }\n        },\n        \"fetch\": {\n          \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"url\": \"https://jasonbase.com/things/jYJ.json\"\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$return.success\"\n          }\n        }\n        ...\n      }\n  ...\n}  Here, the  reset  action only resets the cache.  And  fetch  action only makes a network request and returns its result. (No $render)  Lastly the  refresh  action functions as the main program that triggers each action one after another (triggers  reset , then triggers  fetch , and finally executes  $render )",

Here we use the return value from the  $network.request  and set the header.   This stores the  header  object for the specified  domain  (session.herokuapp.com), and this stored header will be attached to all future  $network.request  to this domain. The header to be stored will look like this:  {\n  \"header\": {\n    \"X-User-Email\": \"ethan@ethan.fm\",\n    \"X-User-Token\": \"fnekz4hf7ghw95m6ks0rf01j\"\n  }\n}   After the  $session.set , it goes to the next action  $href . This transitions to  https://sessionjason.herokuapp.com/posts.json .   This time, the network request will automatically attach the stored header to the request.   The server will recognize the authentication token and respond with the actual  posts.json .",

There are several cases where templating makes sense. \nLearn more here\n\n\nTo achieve this we use templates.\n\n\n\n\nTemplates have slots (\n{{ }}\n) to be filled in.\n\n\nAll expressions inside \n{{ }}\n are evaluated with the data in memory and substituted in.\n\n\nTemplates handle not only evaluation but also support \nlooping (\n#each\n) and conditionals (\n#if/#elseif/#else\n)\n.\n\n\nTemplates are always declared under \n$jason.head.templates\n.\n\n\nMost of the times we just use the \nbody\n template (\n$jason.head.templates.body\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvalid expressions\n\n\nJasonette template engine takes advantage of the native javascript engine. This means:\n\n\n1. Any expression that evaluates to a value.\n\n\n{\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"image\",\n      \"url\": \"{{$jason.image}}\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"label\",\n      \"text\": \"{{$jason.username}}\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\n2. Any javascript expression.\n\n\nJasonette implements the native javascript engine to evaluate expressions. So you can use any javascript expression inside \n{{ }}\n.\n\n\n{\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"label\",\n      \"url\": \"Full JSON string\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"label\",\n      \"text\": \"{{JSON.stringify($jason)}}\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\n3. A full fledged javascript function.\n\n\nIf it involves multiple instructions, you can even write a full fledged function inside the template expression.\n\n\nJust make sure to end with a \nreturn\n statement.\n\n\n{\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"label\",\n      \"url\": \"Reversed Fullname\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"label\",\n      \"text\": \"{{var sorted_posts = $jason.posts.sort(function(a,b){ return new Date(b.created_at) - new Date(a.created_at); }); return sorted_posts[0];}}\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\nexample\n\n\nHere's an example where we use the \n$geo.get\n action to get the current location, and render it dynamically using the template.\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"title\": \"Display location\",\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"type\": \"$geo.get\",\n        \"success\": {\n          \"type\": \"$render\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          \"sections\": [{\n            \"items\": [\n              {\n                \"type\": \"label\",\n                \"text\": \"Latitude: {{ $jason.coord.split(',')[0] }}\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"type\": \"label\",\n                \"text\": \"Longitude: {{ $jason.coord.split(',')[1] }}\"\n              }           \n            ]\n          }]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nIn above JSON markup, the \n$jason.body\n part is missing, because we will dynamically generate it via \n$render\n.\n\n\nThe \n$render\n action will render the data with the template, and insert it into where \n$jason.body\n should be. The result would be:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"title\": \"Display location\",\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"type\": \"$geo.get\",\n        \"success\": {\n          \"type\": \"$render\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          \"sections\": [{\n            \"items\": [\n              {\n                \"type\": \"label\",\n                \"text\": \"Latitude: {{ $jason.coord.split(',')[0] }}\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"type\": \"label\",\n                \"text\": \"Longitude: {{ $jason.coord.split(',')[1] }}\"\n              }           \n            ]\n          }]\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"body\": {\n      \"sections\": [{\n        \"items\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"label\",\n            \"text\": \"Latitude: 12.1234\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"label\",\n            \"text\": \"Longitude: 23.2345\"\n          }           \n        ]\n      }]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nNotice how we now have the \n$jason.body\n filled out.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 Syntax\n\n\nJSON\n\n\nLet's take a look at how JSON templating works:\n\n\n\n\n1. Loop (#each)\n\n\nTo demonstrate looping, let's look at an example. We have a static JSON that looks like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"body\": {\n    \"sections\": [{\n      \"items\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"Homer\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"Marge\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"Lisa\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"Bart\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"Maggie\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }]\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nIF you look at each item, the only part that's custom is the name (\"Homer\", \"Marge\", \"Lisa\", \"Bart\", \"Maggie\"). We want to shorten this so that we don't have to rewrite \n\"type\": \"label\"\n for every item.\n\n\nFirst, we need to declare a data attribute (\nLearn more about \nhead.data\n):\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"data\": {\n        \"members\": [\n          { \"name\": \"Homer\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Marge\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Lisa\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Bart\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Maggie\" }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nThen we will declare a \nbody\n template that will iterate through this \nmembers\n array and turn each into renderable item.\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"data\": {\n        \"members\": [\n          { \"name\": \"Homer\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Marge\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Lisa\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Bart\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Maggie\" }\n        ]\n      },\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          \"sections\": [{\n            \"items\": {\n              \"{{#each members}}\": {\n                \"type\": \"label\",\n                \"text\": \"{{name}}\"\n              }\n            }\n          }]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nThe \n#each\n keyword will iterate through the expression that comes after it (\nmembers\n) and generate a JSON array from the result, ending up with the final JSON markup we saw at the beginning.\n\n\nHow to access variables from inside nested #each\n\n\nWhen there's only a single \n#each\n expression it's simple. But when we have multiple \n#each\n expressions, dealing with context becomes a bit tricky.\n\n\nHere's an example:\n\n\n{\n  \"{{#each families}}\": {\n    \"{{#each members}}\": {\n      \"type\": \"label\",\n      \"text\": \"{{name}}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nWhat if we want to access \nfamilies\n object from inside the nested \n{{#each members}}\n loop? \n\n\nWe can't just do:\n\n\n{\n  \"{{#each families}}\": {\n    \"{{#each members}}\": {\n      \"type\": \"label\",\n      \"text\": \"{{families.length}}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nbecause inside the \n{{#each members}}\n loop, the context is each family member. Above expression will result in the parser trying to access for example \nmembers[0].families.length\n instead of \nfamilies.length\n. It will throw an error because a \nmember\n object doesn't contain a \nfamilies\n attribute.\n\n\nWe need a way to access the root context. This is where \n$root\n comes in.\n\n\nWhenever you're inside a loop, you can refer to the root context using \n$root\n. So above example will be:\n\n\n{\n  \"{{#each families}}\": {\n    \"{{#each members}}\": {\n      \"type\": \"label\",\n      \"text\": \"{{$root.families.length}}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nYou can use the \n$root\n object to access everything at the root level, such as \n$get\n (through \n$root.$get\n), \n$cache\n (through \n$root.$cache\n), \n$global\n (through \n$root.$global\n), etc.\n\n\n\n\n2. Conditional (#if/#elseif/#else)\n\n\nConditionals are used to conditionally render their children only when the expression evaluates to \ntrue\n.\n\n\nConditionals take the form of an \narray\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe parser walks through the array sequentially\n\n\nExecutes each conditional expression\n\n\nAnd Renders the child JSON of the first conditional expression that evaluates to \ntrue\n\n\n\n\nsyntax\n\n\nConditionals take the following format.\n\n\n[\n  {\n    \"{{#if (EXPRESSION A)}}\": (JSON)\n  },\n  {\n    \"{{#elseif (EXPRESSION B)}}\": (JSON)\n  }\n  {\n    \"{{#else (EXPRESSION C)}}\": (JSON)\n  }\n]\n\n\n\nThe template will walk through the items in the array sequentially until it encounters an conditional expression that's true. Then it will only render its child JSON.\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n#elseif\n and \n#else\n are optional.\n\n\nif no conditional expression evaluates to \ntrue\n, nothing gets rendered.\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nLet's say we are are trying to render the following return value (\n$jason\n):\n\n\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"name\": \"Homer\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nWhat happens when we run above data through the following template?\n\n\n{\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": [\n        {\n            \"{{#if $jason.data.name=='Bart'}}\": \"Ay Caramba!\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"{{#elseif $jason.data.name=='Homer'}}\": \"Donuts...\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n\nIt will render the following result:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"label\",\n  \"text\": \"Donuts...\"\n}\n\n\n\n3. \"this\"\n\n\nthis\n is a javascript keyword used to refer to the current context. Let's look at what that means:\n\n\nFor example we want to generate this JSON using \n#each\n:\n\n\n[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": \"Homer\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": \"Marge\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": \"Lisa\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": \"Bart\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": \"Maggie\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n\nIf our data looks like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"members\": [{\"name\": \"Homer\"}, {\"name\": \"Marge\"}, {\"name\": \"Lisa\"}, {\"name\": \"Bart\"}, {\"name\": \"Maggie\"}]\n}\n\n\n\nWe can write the following template:\n\n\n{\n  \"{{#each members}}\": {\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": \"{{name}}\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nBut what if it looked like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"members\": [\"Homer\", \"Marge\", \"Lisa\", \"Bart\", \"Maggie\"]\n}\n\n\n\nNow we're lost. Since each individual element in the \nmembers\n array is just a string instead of an object, \nwe need some way to refer to the object itself\n.\n\n\nThis is where \nthis\n comes in. To handle this situation we can write the following template:\n\n\n{\n  \"{{#each members}}\": {\n    \"type\": \"label\",\n    \"text\": \"{{this}}\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that the change in context makes global objects such as \n$get\n, and \n$cache\n inaccessible. You can use the \n$root\n object to get at them, e.g. \n$root.$get\n.\n\n\nNon-JSON\n\n\nLet's take a look at how non-JSON (CSV, RSS, HTML) templating works:\n\n\nCSV\n\n\nWhen you have a raw CSV content, you can parse it into JSON format before feeding it into a template.\n\n\nTo do this, use \n$convert.csv\n\n\nHere's a functional example\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\nWhen you have an RSS content, you can parse it into JSON format before feeding it into a template.\n\n\nTo do this, use \n$convert.rss\n\n\nHere's a functional example\n\n\n\n\nHTML\n\n\nUnlike other formats like CSV and RSS, Jasonette implements a separate HTML template engine, so we don't need to parse HTML into JSON.\n\n\nInstead, we convert HTML DOM elements into JSON, using the built-in \nHTML to JSON parser\n, which is built on top of \nCheerio library\n, which has similar syntax to \njQuery\n\n\nHow to use\n\n\nStep 1. Make a \n$network.request\n\n\nIt starts with an HTML content. You can fetch HTML content by making \n$network.request\n calls with \ndata_type\n of \nhtml\n, like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n        \"options\": {\n          \"url\": \"http://www.techmeme.com/river\",\n          \"data_type\": \"html\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nStep 2. \n$render\n as html\n\n\nIn order to render it using the html parser, you need to call \n$render\n with \ndata_type\n of \nhtml\n:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n        \"options\": {\n          \"url\": \"http://www.techmeme.com/river\",\n          \"data_type\": \"html\"\n        },\n        \"success\": {\n          \"type\": \"$render\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"type\": \"html\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nStep 3. Use jQuery syntax to parse and render\n\n\nThe HTML template engine automatically sets the \nbody\n element as \n$jason\n.\n\n\nFrom there we can use the \njQuery\n syntax to parse and render content:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n        \"options\": {\n          \"url\": \"http://www.techmeme.com/river\",\n          \"data_type\": \"html\"\n        },\n        \"success\": {\n          \"type\": \"$render\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"type\": \"html\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          \"sections\": [\n            {\n              \"items\": {\n                \"{{#each $jason.find('tr.ritem')}}\": {\n                  \"type\": \"vertical\",\n                  \"components\": [\n                    {\n                      \"type\": \"label\",\n                      \"text\": \"{{$(this).find('td \n a').text()}}\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                      \"type\": \"label\",\n                      \"text\": \"{{$(this).find('cite').text()}}\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                      \"type\": \"label\",\n                      \"text\": \"{{$(this).find('td').first().text() + '  ' + $(this).closest('table').prev().text()}}\"\n                    }\n                  ],\n                  \"href\": {\n                    \"view\": \"web\",\n                    \"url\": \"{{$(this).find('td \n a').attr('href')}}\"\n                  }\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nHere's a functional example\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 When to use templates\n\n\nNormally you can just return a static JSON document from the server and Jason would do its job to render it. However sometimes you may want to dynamically render the view.\n\n\nHere are some cases where using a template makes sense:\n\n\n\n\nMake a separate network request for data, then render the response\n\n\nDynamically render local data\n\n\nDynamically render data generated from device sensors\n\n\nSeparate data from template for less redundancy\n\n\n\n\nLet's take a look at each:\n\n\n\n\n1. Separate data from view\n\n\nMake a separate network request for data, then render the response\nFor example here's a JSON markup that renders a list of labels:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n    },\n    \"body\": {\n      \"sections\": [{\n        \"items\": [{\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 1\"\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 2\"\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 3\"\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 4\"\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 5\"\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 6\"\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 7\"\n        }, {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"This is row 8\"\n        }]\n      }]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the \n\"type\": \"label\"\n part is repeated for each item.\n\n\nInstead of this static JSON, we can use a template/data approach:\n\n\n\n\nReturn a \nbody template\n.\n\n\nMake a separate network request on \n$load\n just to fetch the data.\n\n\nRender the fetched data using the body template.\n\n\n\n\nHere's what it looks like:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"$load\": {\n          \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"url\": \"https://jasonclient.org/rownames.json\"\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$render\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          \"sections\": [{\n            \"items\": {\n              \"{{#each $jason.result}}\": {\n                \"type\": \"label\",\n                \"text\": \"This is row {{row_name}}\"\n              }\n            }\n          }]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice there's no \nbody\n under \n$jason\n here (\n$jason.body\n). It's because we're going to dynamically generate the body using the body template inside \ntemplates\n (\n$jason.head.templates.body\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso notice the \nactions\n attribute contains a $load attribute\n, so this will be triggered as soon as the view loads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo putting all these together, here's what's going on:\n\n\n\n\nThe Jason app loads the JSON shown above, from our server.\n\n\nThere's no \nbody\n attribute so nothing is rendered on the screen by default. However, notice there's a \nbody\n attribute under \ntemplates\n. This is the template that will be rendered as the \nbody\n later.\n\n\nImmediately after the view loads, the \n$load\n action gets automatically triggered by the system.\n\n\n\n\n$load\n makes a \n$network.request\n call with the url specified. We will need to return the following data from the API:\n\n\n{\n    \"result\": [{\n      \"row_name\": \"1\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"2\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"3\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"4\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"5\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"6\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"7\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"8\"\n    }]\n  }\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce \n$network.request\n succeeds, its \nsuccess\n action gets executed next. In this case it's \n$render\n.\n\n\n\n\n$render\n draws the view \nusing the \nbody\n template and the data from the network request\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe result is the same as the \noriginal static JSON\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork request to a 3rd party API:\n Let's say we want to build a Twitter client. What we want to do is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFetch the data by making a network request to Twitter API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRender the data using our own template.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstant plug and play:\n Most web development frameworks nowadays come with JSON API right out of the box. This means you can simply write a template and render your own existing API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Local user input\n\n\nDynamically render local data:\n\n\nYou can render templates using any type of data, which includes \nlocal variables\n you can set using form components such as:\n\n\n\n\ntextfield\n\n\ntextarea\n\n\nsearch\n\n\netc.\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n Below, we render the label using a local variable named \nmessage\n, which is automatically set whenever the \ntextfield\n value changes. \nNote that there is no top level \nbody\n element after \nhead\n.\n Instead we have a \nbody\n template, which will be rendered into body whenever we call the \n$render\n action.\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"$load\": {\n          \"type\": \"$render\"\n        },\n        \"$pull\": {\n          \"type\": \"$render\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          ...\n          \"items\": [\n            {\n              \"type\": \"textfield\",\n              \"name\": \"message\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"label\"\n              \"text\": {{$get.message}}\"\n            }\n          ]\n          ...\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n3. Device API generated data\n\n\nDynamically render data generated from device APIs\n\n\n\n\ngeolocation\n\n\naddressbook\n\n\ncamera\n\n\ntimer\n\n\netc.\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n Below, we access the geolocation device sensor and render its result. Since our server has no knowledge of the device sensor data, templates are the only way to go in this case.\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"$load\": {\n          \"type\": \"$geo.get\",\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$render\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          ...\n          \"items\": [\n            {\n              \"type\": \"label\"\n              \"text\": {{$jason.coord}}\"\n            }\n          ]\n          ...\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n4. Reduce redundancy\n\n\nSeparate data from template for less redundancy\n\n\nSometimes you simply want to separate view from model to avoid lots of code redundancy. See the below \ndata\n section for details.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 What can be rendered\n\n\n1. Inline data\n\n\nThe \nhead.data\n attribute is used to automatically fill in the \nbody\n template if one exists.\n\n\nWhen a view loads,\n\n\n\n\nJasonette looks at \n$jason.head.data\n and \n$jason.head.templates.body\n.\n\n\nIf both exist, it dynamically generates the view using the data and the template, and inserts it into \n$jason.body\n.\n\n\n\n\nHere's a Jason markup \nwithout\n a template/data. As you can see, the label items mostly repeat, except for the \ntext\n attribute.\n\n\n{\n  ...\n  \"body\": {\n    \"sections\": [\n      \"items\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"Ethan\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"color\": \"#000000\",\n            \"size\": \"14\",\n            \"font\": \"HelveticaNeue-Bold\",\n            \"padding\": \"10\",\n            \"background\": \"rgba(0,0,0,0.5)\",\n            \"width\": \"300\",\n            \"height\": \"100\"\n          }\n        }\n        ...\n        {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"John\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"color\": \"#000000\",\n            \"size\": \"14\",\n            \"font\": \"HelveticaNeue-Bold\",\n            \"padding\": \"10\",\n            \"background\": \"rgba(0,0,0,0.5)\",\n            \"width\": \"300\",\n            \"height\": \"100\"\n          }\n        }\n        {\n          \"type\": \"label\",\n          \"text\": \"Samantha\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"color\": \"#000000\",\n            \"size\": \"14\",\n            \"font\": \"HelveticaNeue-Bold\",\n            \"padding\": \"10\",\n            \"background\": \"rgba(0,0,0,0.5)\",\n            \"width\": \"300\",\n            \"height\": \"100\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nUsing template/data, we can reduce it down to:\n\n\n{\n  \"head\": {\n    \"data\": {\n      \"names\": [\"Ethan\", ..., \"John\", \"Samantha\"]\n    },\n    \"templates\": {\n      \"body\": {\n        \"sections\": [{\n          \"items\": {\n            \"{{#each names}}\": {\n              \"type\": \"label\",\n              \"text\": \"Ethan\",\n              \"style\": {\n                \"color\": \"#000000\",\n                \"size\": \"14\",\n                \"font\": \"HelveticaNeue-Bold\",\n                \"padding\": \"10\",\n                \"background\": \"rgba(0,0,0,0.5)\",\n                \"width\": \"300\",\n                \"height\": \"100\"\n              }\n            }\n          }]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n2. Return value of an action\n\n\nBut templates really shine when you use it to render dynamic data, produced by running some action on the device.\n\n\nThis is essential, since your server has no knowledge of what it should render if the data to render is a result of user interaction.\n\n\nSee here\n for details.\n\n\n3. Manually specify data\n\n\nThis is rarely needed, but sometimes we need a way to manually specify data for the \n$render\n action.\n\n\nSee here\n for details.",

We want to shorten this so that we don't have to rewrite  \"type\": \"label\"  for every item.  First, we need to declare a data attribute ( Learn more about  head.data ):  {\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"data\": {\n        \"members\": [\n          { \"name\": \"Homer\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Marge\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Lisa\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Bart\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Maggie\" }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}  Then we will declare a  body  template that will iterate through this  members  array and turn each into renderable item.  {\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"data\": {\n        \"members\": [\n          { \"name\": \"Homer\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Marge\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Lisa\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Bart\" },\n          { \"name\": \"Maggie\" }\n        ]\n      },\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          \"sections\": [{\n            \"items\": {\n              \"{{#each members}}\": {\n                \"type\": \"label\",\n                \"text\": \"{{name}}\"\n              }\n            }\n          }]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}  The  #each  keyword will iterate through the expression that comes after it ( members ) and generate a JSON array from the result, ending up with the final JSON markup we saw at the beginning.",

It will throw an error because a  member  object doesn't contain a  families  attribute.  We need a way to access the root context. This is where  $root  comes in.

Instead of this static JSON, we can use a template/data approach:   Return a  body template .  Make a separate network request on  $load  just to fetch the data.  Render the fetched data using the body template.   Here's what it looks like:  {\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      ...\n      \"actions\": {\n        \"$load\": {\n          \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"url\": \"https://jasonclient.org/rownames.json\"\n          },\n          \"success\": {\n            \"type\": \"$render\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"templates\": {\n        \"body\": {\n          \"sections\": [{\n            \"items\": {\n              \"{{#each $jason.result}}\": {\n                \"type\": \"label\",\n                \"text\": \"This is row {{row_name}}\"\n              }\n            }\n          }]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}    Notice there's no  body  under  $jason  here ( $jason.body ). It's because we're going to dynamically generate the body using the body template inside  templates  ( $jason.head.templates.body ).    Also notice the  actions  attribute contains a $load attribute , so this will be triggered as soon as the view loads.    So putting all these together, here's what's going on:   The Jason app loads the JSON shown above, from our server.  There's no  body  attribute so nothing is rendered on the screen by default. However, notice there's a  body  attribute under  templates . This is the template that will be rendered as the  body  later.  Immediately after the view loads, the  $load  action gets automatically triggered by the system.   $load  makes a  $network.request  call with the url specified. We will need to return the following data from the API:  {\n    \"result\": [{\n      \"row_name\": \"1\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"2\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"3\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"4\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"5\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"6\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"7\"\n    }, {\n      \"row_name\": \"8\"\n    }]\n  }    Once  $network.request  succeeds, its  success  action gets executed next. In this case it's  $render .   $render  draws the view  using the  body  template and the data from the network request .   The result is the same as the  original static JSON    Network request to a 3rd party API:  Let's say we want to build a Twitter client. What we want to do is:    Fetch the data by making a network request to Twitter API.    Render the data using our own template.    Instant plug and play:  Most web development frameworks nowadays come with JSON API right out of the box. This means you can simply write a template and render your own existing API.",

Whenever Jasonette loads a single JSON file here's what happens:\n\n\n\n\nLoad JSON from a URL.\n\n\nJasonette scans the JSON to resolve the mixins if any.\n\n\nSometimes it's not enough to resolve it once, especially when you mix \nremote mixins with local mixins\n. Jasonette continues mixin resolution until everything is resolved.\n\n\nJasonette draws the view.\n\n\nThe system triggers \n$load\n / \n$show\n events.\n\n\n\n\n Note 1: All mixins resolutions are carried out in parallel, and the rendering starts only when all mixins have resolved (or failed).\n\n\n Note 2: In case an endpoint doesn't respond or returns an error, that part gets resolved as an empty string and silently fails instead of halting everything.\n\n\n Note 3: The order is important. Since the mixin resolution happens BEFORE actual rendering, you can even mix-in a template expression from a remote JSON\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0 Multiple Mixins\n\n\nYou are not limited to a single mixin.

Here's how you would do it:\n\n\n{\n  \"items\": [{\n    \"@\": \"https://jasonbase.com/thing/dnf.json\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a custom label\"\n  }]\n}\n\n\n\nHere's what happens when Jasonette sees this JSON:\n\n\n\n\nIt first mixes the referenced JSON in.\n\n\nAnd then it goes through the rest of the attributes.\n\n\nIf there's a collision, it overrides the mixed-in value with the local value.\n\n\nKeep going until all key/value pairs are processed.\n\n\n\n\nIn this case it ends up overriding the \ntext\n attribute.

Jasonette continues mixin resolution until everything is resolved.  Jasonette draws the view.  The system triggers  $load  /  $show  events.    Note 1: All mixins resolutions are carried out in parallel, and the rendering starts only when all mixins have resolved (or failed).   Note 2: In case an endpoint doesn't respond or returns an error, that part gets resolved as an empty string and silently fails instead of halting everything.   Note 3: The order is important.

File URL\n\n\nAnother URL scheme Jasonette supports is local file scheme (\nfile://\n).\n\n\nInstead of using \nhttp\n or \nhttps\n, you can refer directly to your local file bundled up with the app. There are currently two ways to use the file URL scheme:\n\n\n\n\nUsing File URL Scheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Home URL \n\n\nInstead of setting a remote URL you can point it to a local JSON file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's what it looks like on Android:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's what it looks like on iOS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB. HREF\n\n\nYou can also \nhref\n into local JSON URLs:\n\n\n\n\n    {\n      \ntype\n: \nlabel\n,\n      \ntext\n: \nGo\n,\n      \nhref\n: {\n        \nurl\n: \nfile://demo.json\n\n      }\n    }\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStoring files locally\n\n\nTo utilize this feature, you first need to store files under the right folders. Let me show you how:\n\n\n\n\niOS File URL\n\n\n\n\nOpen XCode, go to \nJasonette \n Core \n file://\n from the sidebar, and add your files there by drag and dropping.\n\n\nAccess using \nfile://your_filename.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Android File URL\n\n\n\n\nOpen Android Studio, go to \napp \n assets \n file\n. Copy and paste your files there.\n\n\nAccess using \nfile://your_filename.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Disclaimer: The file url scheme is currently limited to the home URL and \nhref\ns. It doesn't include mixins, requires, network.request. If you would like to add these features to Jasonette, feel free to send a pull request and contribute!)\n\n\n\n\n3. Offline Caching\n\n\nYou can have best of both worlds (Stream the app on demand to keep it up-to-date all the time, as well as have the app logic cached locally so it loads instantly) by using the offline caching feature.\n\n\n\n\nHow offline caching works\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first time the app loads, Jasonette fetches the JSON from your server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you specify that you want to use offline caching, Jasonette will cache the entire JSON for that view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext time you open the view, Jasonette will load immediately from the offline cached version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it doesn't stop there, Jaasonette checks to see if the network is available, and if it is, it re-fetches the JSON and updates the view. The trick is \nstep 3\n comes first, so it will ONLY update if the network is available. Otherwise you'll still have your offline cached version of your app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to use\n\n\nOffline caching is managed on a per-view basis. All you need to do to enable is put \n\"offline\": \"true\"\n under \n$jason.head\n, like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"$jason\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"title\": \"offline test\",\n      \"offline\": \"true\",\n      ...\n}",

Check out \nGetting Started with Jasonette\n first.\n\n\n\n\nJSON Web Container\n\n\nWhat if you could take any number of web elements, plug them straight into a native app layout, resize, scroll, interact with, and pretty much treat them just like any other \nnative components\n?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb Containers are self-contained web views that render into native app layout as native components.\n\n\nOf course, the great part is you can describe them all in JSON, just like the rest of \nJasonette components\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb containers are designed to be plugged into a native app layout alongside other \nnative components\n.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see in above example, it's a combination of JSON and HTML.\n\n\nFirst, use HTML/CSS/Javascript to describe the internals of the container view.\n\n\nThen, \nplug it into your native app using JSON\n as just another \ncomponent\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n            \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nNotice\n\n\nWeb containers in action\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\nWhat is possible?\n\n\nUsage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice\n\n\nBefore we jump in, just a few things:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe web container performs pretty nicely on modern mobile devices, in fact so nicely that sometimes you forget that you're using web containers. But don't go overboard with it. Native will always be more performant and you should use native whenever possible. Try experimenting and you'll reach the sweet spot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA lot of design decisions around Web containers were made specifically for displaying rich dynamic content, which used to be tricky using just native components. Try to think of this as just another \ncomponent\n and try not to use the web container to implement app logic. It will most likely result in bad user experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can do a lot of cool things with this, such as implementing little animations here and there without having to invent a whole new JSON syntax because you can now just use CSS or Javascript animation. Also you can do things like text overlay over image simply by using CSS positioning. \nPlease share cool use cases you find\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is just the first draft and intentionally minimal. We may add more features depending on how it goes. Feedback appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb Containers in Action\n\n\nWeb containers can be used both as a \nfullscreen background\n and as an \ninline component\n. Here are some examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnime.js (Mix and match with native)\n\n\nNative feed view + partial web\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3.js (Native slider controller + Web container output)\n\n\nCanvas + JS Demo (Background type)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnime.js (Animated HTML element inside native scroll view)\n\n\nPhaser.js (Background type, with user interaction)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree.js (background type)\n\n\nThree.js (background type)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nUse alongside native components\n\n\nWeb containers plug into native layout alongside other native components so seamlessly that you won't even be able to tell the difference in most cases. It's just like any other \ncomponent\n! Style and use them together with other native Jasonette components.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissolve right into native layout\n\n\nSame native \nlayout system\n you already know. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll just like other components\n\n\nSince it's just like any other component, you can use it in a scroll view, and scroll it just like label, button, image, etc.\n\n\n[Note] This is possible because of the \ndesign decision\n made to make the contents inside a web container NOT scrollable when contained within a scroll view (for obvious UX reasons).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr use as fullscreen background\n\n\nNot just for scrolling components. you can use it as a background by setting \"html\" type for background.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite once, use anywhere\n\n\nYou can use \nmix-ins\n to write a single HTML container inside JSON and mix them into any context such as the background or a layout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is possible?\n\n\nSince each Web container is basically a self-contained web view, you can do anything you can do with a browser, which includes any HTML markup, Javascript, and CSS styling.\n\n\n\n\nCanvas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSVG \n CSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\niframe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJavascript\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteraction between native actions and Web container\n\n\nTemplates\n work exactly the same as the rest of Jasonette. So you can use native UI elements as input, set \nlocal variables\n, and re-render accordingly using the local variable to dynamically display output onto the web container. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMix and match\n\n\nJasonette already has most of what you need to build sophisticated native apps, even without the web container.\n\n\nBut web containers can be powerful when seamlessly blended into the rest of the native app to perform things that were hard to do with existing Jasonette api.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nImportant Tips (MUST READ)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\n\n\n1. As Component\n\n\nJust like rest of the Jasonette \ncomponents\n, you can plug it into \nlayouts\n and \nscroll views(sections)\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nweb containers plugged in everywhere\n\n\nusing web container to animate text via JS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\n: \n\"html\"\n\n\ntext\n: A self contained HTML text (\nhtml\n...\n/html\n), which means everything from \nscript\n tag to \nstyle\n tag.\n\n\nstyle\n: \nRequired. Especially the height\n. Web containers should NOT scroll, therefore everything outside of the \nstyle.height\n you specify will get cut off. This attribute is about how the web container looks from the outside. To style the HTML elements inside, just include the CSS inside the HTML markup. \n\n\naction\n: (optional) Connect with any \naction\n or a web container specific action: \n\"type\": \"$default\"\n.\n\n\n[IMPORTANT]\n By default, web container content DOES NOT respond to user touch. This means if you click on a link inside the HTML, it won't do anything.\n\n\nIn order to override this behavior, attach a \n\"type\": \"$default\"\n action, so the web container knows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\n  \nitems\n: [{\n    \ntype\n: \nhtml\n,\n    \ntext\n: \nhtml\n....\n/html\n,\n        \nstyle\n: {\n            \nheight\n: \n100\n\n        },\n    \naction\n: {\n      \ntype\n: \n$default\n\n    }\n  }]\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.

Must specify height when in scroll view\n\n\nEvery web container must have a fixed height when inside a scroll view (sections).\n\n\nThis is so that there exists no scrolling view within a scroll view, which is a bad user experience.\n\n\n{\n    ...\n    \nsections\n: [{\n        \nitems\n: [{\n            \ntype\n: \nhtml\n,\n            \ntext\n: \nhtml\n....\n/html\n,\n            \nstyle\n: {\n                \nheight\n: \n100\n\n            },\n            \naction\n: {\n                \ntype\n: \n$default\n\n            }\n        }, {\n            ...\n        }],\n        ...\n    }]\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Use single quotes\n\n\nObviously, an entire HTML markup can be a long text. Sometimes it will contain double quotes and some characters that need to be escaped.\n\n\nSince we're trying to package an entire HTML markup into a text attribute, you'll either need to escape these characters or use single quotes instead of double quotes.\n\n\n\n\n4. Wrap all script content inside \nwindow.onload = function() { ... }\n\n\nBecause of the way native scroll views recycle their child items, you need to make sure your javascript lines are run AFTER the container has loaded.\n\n\nTo do this, wrap your Javascript inside \nwindow.onload\n. Here's an example:\n\n\n{\n  \ntype\n: \nhtml\n,\n  \ntext\n: \nhtml\nhead\nstyle\n.square{background: red; width: 50px; height: 50px;}\n/style\nscript src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/2.0.0/anime.min.js'\n/script\nscript\nvar x=200; var move = function() {var el = document.querySelector('#domNode .el'); var domNode = anime({ targets: el, translateX: x, translateY: x}); x=200-x;}; document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(event) { setInterval(move, 1000); }); \n/script\nbody\ndiv id='domNode'\ndiv class='large square el'\n/div\n/div\n/body\n/html\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. By default, the HTML content does NOT respond to user input\n\n\nHTML content inside a web container is NOT interactive by default. This means NOTHING will happen when you touch the contents inside, even if it's a link. (Especially if it's a link, because it would be weird to have a small portion of a native app redirect to a completely different web page)\n\n\n\n\nThe interaction is disabled by default because the web container is designed as a \ndynamic output method\n and \nNOT as an input method\n.\n\n\n\n\nWeb containers are very useful when it comes to \ndisplaying rich dynamic content\n, and this is the primary purpose of the web container. Also, in most cases we want to trigger native actions instead of letting the HTML content handle events. If we allowed HTML to handle user touch for example, then we wouldn't have a way to take advantage of Jasonette's \nnative actions\n.\n\n\n\n\nSo whenever possible, use native components such as \ntextarea\n or \ntextfield\n to receive user input instead of trying to use the HTML\nform\n element. \n\n\nAlso, keep in mind pure native components generally perform better too. Just use it wisely.\n\n\n\n\nThat said, there are some cases where it does make sense to let the HTML handle events. In which case you could:\n\n\n\n\n6. Use the \n\"type\": \"$default\"\n action to force Jasonette to let HTML handle events.\n\n\nIf you know what you're doing, you can override the block and let the HTML handle user events.\n\n\n{\n    \ntype\n: \nhtml\n,\n    \ntext\n: \nhtml\nbody\nscript src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js'\nscript\n$(function(){$(document).on('click', function(){ $('body').css('background', '#ff0000'); }); });\n/script\n/body\n/html\n,\n    \naction\n: {\n        \ntype\n: \n$default\n\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Details\n\n\nUnder the hood, each web container is a containerized instance of web view (\nUIWebView for iOS\n and \nWebView for Android\n).\n\n\nIt gets recycled when you scroll just like rest of the native components so it's pretty efficient.",

Of course, the great part is you can describe them all in JSON, just like the rest of  Jasonette components .     Web containers are designed to be plugged into a native app layout alongside other  native components .   As you can see in above example, it's a combination of JSON and HTML.

But don't go overboard with it. Native will always be more performant and you should use native whenever possible. Try experimenting and you'll reach the sweet spot.    A lot of design decisions around Web containers were made specifically for displaying rich dynamic content, which used to be tricky using just native components. Try to think of this as just another  component  and try not to use the web container to implement app logic. It will most likely result in bad user experience.    You can do a lot of cool things with this, such as implementing little animations here and there without having to invent a whole new JSON syntax because you can now just use CSS or Javascript animation. Also you can do things like text overlay over image simply by using CSS positioning.  Please share cool use cases you find .    This is just the first draft and intentionally minimal.

(No, really, please someone write an extension.)\n\n\nIntegrate Jasonette with existing code:\n Already have your own app code? Plug in Jasonette to your existing app with just a few lines!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtension vs. Integration\n\n\nBoth extending and integrating involve writing native iOS code. But here's the difference:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtending Jasonette\n means you're extending Jasonette itself. This means:\n\n\n\n\nAll your custom modules will be JSON powered, just like the rest of Jasonette.\n\n\nYou will need to follow a simple convention when writing the extension. \n\n\nYou can share it with the community when you're done. If it's useful enough it may even be integrated into the main codebase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrating with Jasonette\n means you already have existing code and are using Jasonette only partially. This means:\n\n\n\n\nYou can start using Jasonette in your existing app instantly, without re-writing anything. Just a few lines of code necessary.\n\n\nYou will be able to take advantage of all of Jasonette's power whenever you use the Jasonette view.\n\n\nThe only drawback is you can't control your own non-Jasonette code with JSON\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtending Jasonette is the recommended way in most cases,\n since it requires very little additional effort, but automatically comes with the power to control your own custom native modules via JSON.\n\n\n\n\n\u2605  Extension\n\n\nLet's jump into writing extensions! There are two things you can extend: \nComponents\n and \nActions\n\n\n1. Extend UI Components\n\n\nJasonette comes with various \nUI components\n right out of the box, but you can easily build your own native component if you need to. Just follow the instructions below to write your component class, and you will instantly be able to summon your component within the \nJasonette layout system\n simply by describing in JSON.\n\n\n1.1. How to write a UI Component class\n\n\nAll you need to do is write a class with a single builder method that returns a \nUIView\n subclass. Here's how:\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. Create a \nJasonComponent\n subclass\n\n\nThe example below demonstrates how to create a \nmap\n component.\n\n\nJust remember the following rules:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a class that inherits from \nJasonComponent.h\n.\n\n\nThe class name should follow this convention: \nJason(COMPONENT_NAME)Component\n\n\nOnly the first character of the COMPONENT_NAME should be capitalized\n\n\n\n\nSo, to create a \nmap\n component:\n\n\n\n\nwe create a subclass of \nJasonComponent\n\n\nAnd name it \nJasonMapComponent\n (Notice the capitalization).\n\n\nWe also import \nMapKit\n since we will need to access the iOS MapKit API.\n\n\n\n\nHere's the result:\n\n\n// JasonMapComponent.h\n#import \"JasonComponent.h\"\n#import \nMapKit/MapKit.h\n\n@interface JasonMapComponent : JasonComponent \nMKMapViewDelegate\n\n@end\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Implement the builder method\n\n\nYou only need to implement a single class method:\n\n\n+ (UIView \n)build: (UIView\n)component withJSON: (NSDictionary \n)json withOptions: (NSDictionary \n)options\n.\n\n\nBasically it's a builder method that takes three arguments to create a UIView subclass. The arguments are:\n\n\nA. \ncomponent\n: A UIView instance to fill in. Just assume that a UIView will be passed in, and repurpose it to your liking.\n\n\nB. \njson\n: A JSON snippet in NSDictionary format which includes all the information we need to construct this component.\n\n\nC. \noptions\n: Useful in a few cases but you don't need to use this in most cases, so let's not worry about it here.\n\n\nThe result can be a UILabel, UIButton, or whatever, as long as it's a subclass of \nUIView\n.\n\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n\nWhen Jasonette is building a layout, it will call this \nbuild:withJSON:withOptions\n method, passing in a relevant UIView instance (\ncomponent\n) as well as the JSON blueprint (\njson\n) from which you will build your own UIView subclass.\n\n\nFrom here, all you need to do is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck if the \ncomponent\n is nil. If it's nil, create a new instance. If it's not, then we just reuse it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruct your own custom UIView subclass instance based on the \njson\n object received, and return. You're done!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's what the most primitive version would look like:\n\n\n// JasonMapComponent.m\n@implementation JasonMapComponent\n+ + (UIView *)build: (UIView*)component withJSON: (NSDictionary *)json withOptions: (NSDictionary *)options{\n  MKMapView *mapView;\n  if(component){\n    mapView = (MKMapView*)component;\n  } else {\n    mapView = [[MKMapView alloc] init];\n  }\n  return mapView;\n}\n@end\n\n\n\nThis works since \nMKMapView\n is a subclass of \nUIView\n.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. And that's it!\n\n\nThis is seriously all we need to do! Our map component is now 100% powered by JSON, just like rest of the \nJasonette components\n.\n\n\nHere's an example of how we would summon our \nmap\n component.\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"vertical\",\n  \"components\": [\n    { \"type\": \"label\", \"text\": \"This is a map\" },\n    { \"type\": \"map\" }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\nSo how does this work behind the scenes? Whenever Jasonette encounters a component description, \n\n\n\n\nIt looks at its \ntype\n first. Here we see the \n{\"type\": \"map\"}\n, so it's a \nmap\n component.\n\n\nBased on this, it looks for a class named \nJasonMapComponent\n (Remember the naming convention is: \nJason(COMPONENT_NAME_WITH_FIRST_LETTER_CAPITALIZED)Component\n\n\nWhen it finds the component class, it runs its \nbuild:withOptions:\n method to finally build the component.\n\n\n\n\nOf course, this is a simplified version of how the actual \nmap\n component works. In reality the \njson\n object would contain more information than just \n{ \"type\": \"map\" }\n. It may look something like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"map\",\n  \"region\": {\n    \"coord\": \"40.7409395,-74.0083886\",\n    \"width\": \"50\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nAll you need to do is take this, parse it, and customize the \nmapView\n object before returning, like the comment below.\n\n\n// JasonMapComponent.m\n@implementation JasonMapComponent\n+ (UIView *)build: (UIView*)component withJSON: (NSDictionary *)json withOptions: (NSDictionary *)options{\n  MKMapView *mapView;\n  if(component){\n    mapView = (MKMapView*)component;\n  } else {\n    mapView = [[MKMapView alloc] init];\n  }\n\n  /*\n    Do some customization with the 'json' argument here.\n  */\n\n  return mapView;\n}\n@end\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2. Tips on writing component classes\n\n\n\n\nA. Keep it stateless and self contained\n\n\nThese component builder classes and methods are stateless by design. That's why the \nbuild:withOptions:\n method is \na class method\n that simply takes a \nNSDictionary\n as input and returns a \nUIView\n as output.\n\n\n\n\nB. Use class methods\n\n\nLike mentioned above, Jasonette requires that all the component methods are implemented as class methods.\n\n\nYou may ask \"But there's a delegate method I'm trying to use for handling events, and it's an instance method only. How do I deal with this?\".\n\n\nWell, in objective-c, classes are also objects, so you can in fact call them the same way you call an instance method.\n\n\nJust switch out the instance method with its class method version\n (use \n+\n instead of \n-\n at the beginning of the method definition), like below:\n\n\n// JasonMapComponent.m\n@implementation JasonMapComponent\n+ (UIView *)build: (UIView*)component withJSON: (NSDictionary *)json withOptions: (NSDictionary *)options{\n  MKMapView *mapView;\n  if(component){\n    mapView = (MKMapView*)component;\n  } else {\n    mapView = [[MKMapView alloc] init];\n  }\n\n  /*\n    Do some customization with the 'json' argument here\n  */\n\n  mapView.delegate = self;\n\n  return mapView;\n}\n\n+ (void)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView didUpdateUserLocation:(MKUserLocation *)userLocation{\n  /*\n    Handle the event\n  */\n}\n@end\n\n\n\nHere we implement\n\n\n+ (void)mapView:(MKMapView \n)mapView didUpdateUserLocation:(MKUserLocation \n)userLocation\n\n\nto handle MapKit events.\n\n\n\n\nC. Take advantage of the built-in stylize method\n\n\nA lot of style attributes such as background, width, height, corner_radius, opacity, etc. are common across various types of components.\n\n\nJasonComponent\n class has a built-in method that you can utilize to automatically apply these styles. It's called:\n\n\n+ (void) stylize: (NSDictionary \n)json component: (UIView \n)component\n.\n\n\nJust by calling this method once, you can take advantage of all the following style attributes right out of the box!\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"mycustomitem\",\n  \"style\": {\n    \"width\": \"...\",\n    \"height\": \"...\",\n    \"opacity\": \"...\",\n    \"background\": \"...\",\n    \"color\": \"...\",\n    \"corner_radius\": \"...\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nHere's an example code that creates a UIView, runs it through the built-in \nstylize\n, and then applies additional custom styles.\n\n\n+ (UIView *)build: (UIView*)component withJSON: (NSDictionary *)json withOptions: (NSDictionary *)options{\n  // Build some component here\n  MKMapView *mapView;\n  if(component){\n    mapView = (MKMapView*)component;\n  } else {\n    mapView = [[MKMapView alloc] init];\n  }\n\n  /*\n  customize the component here\n  */\n\n  // run it through the default stylize method\n  [self stylize: json component: component];\n\n  // Add your own custom styling logic here, on top of the default styling above\n  if(style[@\"rotate\"] {\n    // some custom styling logic ....\n  }\n\n  return component;\n}\n\n\n\nYou don't even need to include an additional file, since the \nstylize\n method comes for free just by subclassing \nJasonComponent\n\n\n\n\n2. Extend Actions\n\n\nJust like components, you can easily write your own native \naction\n modules and call them using 100% JSON syntax.\n\n\nOne thing to keep in mind: \nAction classes contain a collection of related action methods\n, which is why most actions are namespaced as \n$(GROUPNAME).(METHODNAME)\n when you call it. \n\n\nFor example \nJasonNetworkAction\n class--an action class that deals with network requests--contains multiple methods: \nrequest\n, \nupload\n, \nauth\n, \nunauth\n. Each method can be invoked by Jasonette using \n$network.request\n, \n$network.auth\n, \n$network.upload\n, and \n$network.unauth\n actions.\n\n\n\n\n2.1. How to write an Action\n\n\nLet's try writing an action class (\n$util\n) and one of its methods which displays a banner (\n$util.banner\n).\n\n\nWe would like to parse this JSON markup:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"title\": \"Hello\",\n    \"description\": \"Hello world!\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nto display a notification banner that looks like this:\n\n\n[IMAGE]\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. Create an Action Class\n\n\nThree rules for writing your action class:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a class that inherits from \nJasonAction.h\n.\n\n\nThe class name should follow the following convention: \nJason(GROUP_NAME)Action\n\n\nOnly the first character of the GROUP_NAME should be capitalized\n\n\n\n\nTo create a class that responds to \n$util.banner\n, we first need a class for the \nutil\n group. Following the rule, we need to create a \nJasonUtilAction\n, which inherits from \nJasonAction\n:\n\n\n//  JasonUtilAction.h\n#import \"JasonAction.h\"\n@interface JasonUtilAction : JasonAction\n@end\n\n//  JasonUtilAction.m\n#import \"JasonUtilAction.h\"\n@implementation JasonUtilAction\n@end\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Write an Action Method\n\n\nThree rules for naming an action method:\n\n\n\n\nIt should be an \ninstance method\n.\n\n\nIts return value should be \nvoid\n.\n\n\nWhatever you name your method will respond to an action call \n$[GROUP_NAME].[METHOD_NAME]\n.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, to handle \n$util.banner\n action we need to implement an \ninstance method\n, and its name should be \nbanner\n, like this:\n\n\n//  JasonUtilAction.h\n#import \"JasonAction.h\"\n@interface JasonUtilAction : JasonAction\n@end\n\n//  JasonUtilAction.m\n#import \"JasonUtilAction.h\"\n@implementation JasonUtilAction\n- (void)banner{\n    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\n        [[TWMessageBarManager sharedInstance] showMessageWithTitle: @\"Banner Title\"\n                                                       description: @\"Here goes banner description\"\n                                                              type: TWMessageBarMessageTypeInfo];\n    });\n    [[Jason client] success];\n}\n@end\n\n\n\nThis will display a banner when the following action is triggered\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$util.banner\"\n}\n\n\n\nNotice the \n[[Jason client] success]\n line. This is how your action signals that its job is over. More on this later.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Pass arguments to the action\n\n\nIn the previous example we hardcoded the title and description for the banner. But a component that displays the same text all the time is not cool. Instead we want to pass some arguments and have them customize how the action is run. For example, we want the \n$util.banner\n action to take an \noptions\n attribute and build a custom banner, like this:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"title\": \"Yo\",\n    \"description\": \"Dawg\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nTo access the \noptions\n attribute of an action, simply use \nself.options\n inside the method, like this:\n\n\n//  JasonUtilAction.h\n#import \"JasonAction.h\"\n@interface JasonUtilAction : JasonAction\n@end\n\n//  JasonUtilAction.m\n#import \"JasonUtilAction.h\"\n@implementation JasonUtilAction\n- (void)banner{\n\n    // Extract title and description out of self.options!\n    NSString *title = self.options[@\"title\"];\n    NSString *description = self.options[@\"description\"];\n\n    // Use the custom title and description instead of hardcoding!\n    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\n        [[TWMessageBarManager sharedInstance] showMessageWithTitle: title\n                                                       description: description\n                                                              type: TWMessageBarMessageTypeInfo];\n    });\n    [[Jason client] success];\n}\n@end\n\n\n\nYou don't need to define \nself.options\n anywhere because you get it for free just by subclassing \nJasonAction\n.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. End the action\n\n\nYou MUST explicitly signal the end of each action when implementing an action method\n.\n\n\nThis is because we can't assume that all actions end when they reach the last line. \nSome actions trigger asynchronous background tasks, and we need to wait until that task is over.\n \n\n\nTo signal the end of an action we call:\n \n\n\n[[Jason client] success];\n\n\nThis command will:\n\n\n\n\nFinish the current action\n\n\nSee if the current action has a \nsuccess\n attribute, and if it does, proceed to call that action.\n\n\n\n\nHere's an example where we make a network request, and then display a success banner when it succeeds:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"https://imagejason.herokuapp.com\",\n    \"method\": \"post\"\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"title\": \"Success!\",\n      \"description\": \"Successfully posted!\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nThe implementation for \n$network.request\n may look something like this:\n\n\n//  JasonNetworkAction.m\n#import \"JasonNetworkAction.h\"\n@implementation JasonNetworkAction\n...\n- (void)request{\n  AFHTTPSessionManager *manager = [AFHTTPSessionManager manager];\n  ... \n  dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue( DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^(void){\n    [manager POST:url parameters:parameters progress:^(NSProgress * _Nonnull downloadProgress) {\n    } success:^(NSURLSessionDataTask * _Nonnull task, id  _Nullable responseObject) {\n      dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\n        [[Jason client] success];\n      });\n    } failure:^(NSURLSessionDataTask * _Nullable task, NSError * _Nonnull error) {\n    }];\n  });\n}\n... \n@end\n\n\n\nNotice how we call the \n[[Jason client] success]\n line \ninside the \"success\" block, instead of the last line of the method\n. This is because the network request task runs asynchronously and the action shouldn't end until it reaches inside the \nsuccess\n block.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5. Handle exceptions\n\n\nWe can end an action with \n[[Jason client] success]\n when everything goes as expected. But what if something goes wrong? We still need to end the action but also run an exception handling logic, instead of going on to the next action.\n\n\nFor example, the \n$network.request\n may fail because there's no Internet connection. To handle these exceptions, Jason actions have another attribute called \nerror\n, as demonstrated below:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$network.request\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"url\": \"https://imagejason.herokuapp.com\",\n    \"method\": \"post\"\n  },\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"title\": \"Success!\",\n      \"description\": \"Successfully fetched!\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"error\": {\n    \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"title\": \"ERROR!!!!\",\n      \"description\": \"Uh oh, something went wrong!\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nTo signal that the action has ended with an error when we implement action methods, we call:\n\n\n[[Jason client] error];\n.\n\n\nLet's take the previous code and add that line:\n\n\n//  JasonNetworkAction.m\n#import \"JasonNetworkAction.h\"\n@implementation JasonNetworkAction\n...\n- (void)request{\n  AFHTTPSessionManager *manager = [AFHTTPSessionManager manager];\n  ... \n  dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue( DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^(void){\n    [manager POST:url parameters:parameters progress:^(NSProgress * _Nonnull downloadProgress) {\n    } success:^(NSURLSessionDataTask * _Nonnull task, id  _Nullable responseObject) {\n      dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\n        [[Jason client] success];\n      });\n    } failure:^(NSURLSessionDataTask * _Nullable task, NSError * _Nonnull error) {\n      dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\n        [[Jason client] error];\n      });\n    }];\n  });\n}\n... \n@end\n\n\n\nThe code is mostly same as the previous one, except we've added the \n[[Jason client] error];\n inside the \nfailure\n block of the task.\n\n\n\n\nStep 6. Set the return value\n\n\nIn many cases we want to run an action, take its output, and pass it to another action. \n\n\nHere, we run a \n$geo.get\n action, and then display its return value as an alert using \n$util.alert\n.\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"$geo.get\",\n  \"success\": {\n    \"type\": \"$util.banner\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"title\": \"Current Location\",\n      \"description\": \"{{$jason.coord}}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nNotice how we use a variable called \n$jason\n. This is how return values work in Jasonette--if an action has a return value, it passes it along to the next action as a variable named \n$jason\n.\n\n\nTo end an action with a return value, we call:\n\n\n[[Jason client] success: response]\n\n\nTo support the JSON markup above, the \n$geo.get\n action implementation should look like this:\n\n\n// JasonGeoAction.m\n#import \"JasonGeoAction.h\"\n@implementation JasonGeoAction\n- (void)get{\n\n  /*\n     Implement some location sensor logic that populates the 'currentLocation' variable\n  */\n\n  NSString *coord = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%g,%g\", currentLocation.coordinate.latitude, currentLocation.coordinate.longitude];\n  [[Jason client] success: @{@\"coord\": coord}];\n}\n@end\n\n\n\nHere we end \n$geo.get\n with an object \n@{@\"coord\": coord}\n. As mentioned above, this object will be accessible as \n$jason\n in the next action. This is how the \n$util.banner\n action can dynamically build itself using the\n$jason.coord\n value.\n\n\n\n\n\u2605  Integration\n\n\nJasonette by default covers most of what you need to build any app you can imagine. Also you can even extend its \nactions\n and \ncomponents\n, like we discussed above. \n\n\nHowever if you already have existing code and just want to integrate with Jasonette here and there, that's cool too! You don't have to throw away all your existing code and re-write everything just to take advantage of Jasonette!\n\n\nHow it works\n\n\nBasically, \nJasonViewController\n is a self contained class whose only requirement is that you set its \nurl\n before presenting it. This means you can integrate Jasonette just like using any other view controllers in your project.\n\n\n\n\n\u2605 REMEMBER - You will need to either copy all your existing project files into your Jasonette project, or Jasonette files into your own project, before you do this.\n\n\n\n\n1. Non-Jasonette =\n Jasonette\n\n\nHere's how you can open a \nJasonViewController\n from your own viewcontroller\u2014it's the same as opening any other viewcontrollers.\n\n\nA. First, include JasonViewController.h in your viewcontroller\n\n\n#import \"JasonViewController.h\"\n\n\n\nB. Open with push transition:\n\n\nTo open the \nJasonViewController\n with a push transition, do this:\n\n\nJasonViewController *vc = [[JasonViewController alloc] init];\nvc.url = @\"https://jasonbase.com/things/jYJ.json\";\n[self.navigationViewController pushViewController:vc animated:YES];\n\n\n\nC. Open with modal transition:\n\n\nTo open \nJasonViewController\n as a modal, do this:\n\n\nJasonViewController *vc = [[JasonViewController alloc] init];\nvc.url = @\"https://jasonbase.com/things/jYJ.json\";\nUINavigationController *nav = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:vc];\n[self.navigationController presentViewController:nav animated:YES completion:nil];\n\n\n\nAnd that's it for Non-Jasonette =\n Jasonette view transition! Nothing special, just a regular viewcontroller.\n\n\n\n\n2. Jasonette =\n Non-Jasonette\n\n\nThis one's a bit different, since we are transitioning from a \nJasonViewController\n to your custom viewcontroller. \n\n\n\n\n\u2605 REMEMBER - Everything that happens on the Jasonette side is JSON powered.\n\n\nWhich means we need to handle the transition using JSON.\n\n\n\n\nHere's how to transition from a Jasonette view to your custom non-Jasonette view:\n\n\nOption A. Using Storyboard\n\n\nIt works exactly the same as normal Jasonette transitions--simply attach an \nhref\n and set its \nview\n attribute.\n\n\nYou need to name it like this:\n\n\n[STORYBOARD NAME].[STORYBOARD IDENTIFIER FOR THE VIEWCONTROLLER]\n\n\nFor example, to transition to a viewcontroller which has a storyboard ID of \nPaymentViewController\n on a storyboard named \nMainStoryboard.storyboard\n, we do the following:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"label\",\n  \"text\": \"Make a payment\",\n  \"href\": {\n    \"view\": \"MainStoryboard.PaymentViewController\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nOption B. Not using Storyboard\n\n\nIf you don't use storyboard, you can simply enter the viewcontroller's class name. For example, to transition to a \nPaymentViewController\n class,\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"label\",\n  \"text\": \"Make a payment\",\n  \"href\": {\n    \"view\": \"PaymentViewController\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nPassing arguments to your viewcontroller\n\n\nLet's say we now want to pass some arguments to the \nPaymentViewController\n. Here's how we can achieve this:\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. Add an \nNSDictionary\n property called \njason\n to your custom viewcontroller\n\n\nFor example if we wanted our \nPaymentViewController\n to support this feature, we will need to add an \nNSDictionary *jason\n property to the class, like this:\n\n\n// PaymentViewController.h\n#import \nUIKit/UIKit.h\n\n@interface PaymentViewController : UIViewController  \n  ....\n  @property (nonatomic, strong) NSDictionary *jason\n  ....\n@end\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Pass the \noptions\n attribute inside \nhref\n.\n\n\nAnd we're all set! We can now start passing arguments to the \nPaymentViewController\n using the JSON syntax! Here's an example:\n\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"label\",\n  \"text\": \"Make a payment\",\n  \"href\": {\n    \"view\": \"MainStoryboard.PaymentViewController\",\n    \"options\": {\n      \"product_id\": \"3kzf9ela\",\n      \"user_id\": \"3kzf9ela\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Use the \njason\n property in your viewcontroller\n\n\nNow that our \nPaymentViewController\n is receiving the \noptions\n object as \njason\n, we just need to make use of it in the implementation. Example:\n\n\n// PaymentViewController.m\n#import \"PaymentViewController.h\"\n@implementation PaymentViewController\n  ....\n  - (void)viewDidLoad {\n    [super viewDidLoad];\n    NSString *product_id = self.jason[@\"product_id\"];\n    NSString *user_id = self.jason[@\"user_id\"];\n\n    /*\n      Use product_id and user_id for your custom logic!\n    */\n  }\n  ....\n@end",

Basically it's a builder method that takes three arguments to create a UIView subclass. The arguments are:  A.  component : A UIView instance to fill in. Just assume that a UIView will be passed in, and repurpose it to your liking.  B.  json : A JSON snippet in NSDictionary format which includes all the information we need to construct this component.  C.  options : Useful in a few cases but you don't need to use this in most cases, so let's not worry about it here.  The result can be a UILabel, UIButton, or whatever, as long as it's a subclass of  UIView .  Here's how it works:  When Jasonette is building a layout, it will call this  build:withJSON:withOptions  method, passing in a relevant UIView instance ( component ) as well as the JSON blueprint ( json ) from which you will build your own UIView subclass.  From here, all you need to do is:    Check if the  component  is nil. If it's nil, create a new instance. If it's not, then we just reuse it.    Construct your own custom UIView subclass instance based on the  json  object received, and return. You're done!    Here's what the most primitive version would look like:  // JasonMapComponent.m\n@implementation JasonMapComponent\n+ + (UIView *)build: (UIView*)component withJSON: (NSDictionary *)json withOptions: (NSDictionary *)options{\n  MKMapView *mapView;\n  if(component){\n    mapView = (MKMapView*)component;\n  } else {\n    mapView = [[MKMapView alloc] init];\n  }\n  return mapView;\n}\n@end  This works since  MKMapView  is a subclass of  UIView .",

Whenever Jasonette encounters a component description,    It looks at its  type  first. Here we see the  {\"type\": \"map\"} , so it's a  map  component.  Based on this, it looks for a class named  JasonMapComponent  (Remember the naming convention is:  Jason(COMPONENT_NAME_WITH_FIRST_LETTER_CAPITALIZED)Component  When it finds the component class, it runs its  build:withOptions:  method to finally build the component.   Of course, this is a simplified version of how the actual  map  component works. In reality the  json  object would contain more information than just  { \"type\": \"map\" } .
